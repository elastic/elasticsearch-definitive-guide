== Query DSL – powerful search language

Elasticsearch provides an expressive, powerful query language called
the Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) which exposes much of the power
of Lucene through a simple JSON interface.

It is tuned for full text search, but is in no way limited just to that. It
also provides very fast and flexible filters, ranges, geo-location and more.
