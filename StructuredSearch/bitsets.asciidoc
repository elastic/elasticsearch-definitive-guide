At this point, you've seen repeated recommendations to use filters whenever,
due to their performance benefit. But you may be wondering *why* filters are
more performant.

We are going to take a quick detour and talk about how filters work internally.
A good understanding of the internals will let you optimize your queries for
maximum performance.

Filters operate on data structures known as bitsets, which are really nothing
more than arrays of bits (0's and 1's).  The first time a filter is executed,
it iterates over each document and evaluates the filter: _"Does this document
match?"_

If the answer is Yes, a 1 is placed in the bitset for that document; otherwise,
a 0 is recorded.  This is repeated for all the documents in your index.

When the filter is finished, you will have an array of bits representing the
matching status of each document.

The real performance advantage comes the next time the filter is used.  Instead
of iterating over each document, Elasticsearch merely looks at the array of bits
and finds all positions with a 1.

.Independent filter caching
****
Filters are cached independently from the query, which makes them reusable
in many different contexts.  If two different queries use the same filter,
the same filter bitset will be reused.
****

Furthermore, bitsets can be combined using logical bitwise operations.  If you
have two filters that Must match, the two underlying bitsets are logically
ANDed together. This returns a single bitset that is the intersection of the
two previous bitsets.

Logical bitwise operations are _really fast_.  CPUs have dedicated circuits that
perform bitwise operations, meaning these operations are orders of magnitude
faster than loading documents from disk and evaluating their values.
