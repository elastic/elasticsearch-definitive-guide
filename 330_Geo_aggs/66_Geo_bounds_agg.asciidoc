[[geo-bounds-agg]]
=== Geo Bounds Aggregation

In our <<geohash-grid-agg,previous example>>, we filtered our results by using a
bounding box that covered the greater New York area.((("aggregations", "geo_bounds")))((("geo_bounds aggregation")))  However, our results
were all located in downtown Manhattan.  When displaying a map for our user, it
makes sense to zoom into the area of the map that contains the data; there
is no point in showing lots of empty space.

The `geo_bounds` aggregation does exactly this: it calculates the smallest
bounding box that is needed to encapsulate all of the geo-points:

[source,json]
----------------------------
GET /attractions/restaurant/_search
{
  "size" : 0,
  "query": {
    "constant_score": {
      "filter": {
        "geo_bounding_box": {
          "location": {
            "top_left": {
              "lat":  40.8,
              "lon": -74.1
            },
            "bottom_right": {
              "lat":  40.4,
              "lon": -73.9
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "new_york": {
      "geohash_grid": {
        "field":     "location",
        "precision": 5
      }
    },
    "map_zoom": { <1>
      "geo_bounds": {
        "field":     "location"
      }
    }
  }
}
----------------------------
<1> The `geo_bounds` aggregation will calculate the smallest bounding box required to encapsulate all of the documents matching our query.

The response now includes a bounding box that we can use to zoom our map:

[source,json]
----------------------------
...
"aggregations": {
  "map_zoom": {
     "bounds": {
        "top_left": {
           "lat":  40.722,
           "lon": -74.011
        },
        "bottom_right": {
           "lat":  40.715,
           "lon": -73.983
        }
     }
  },
...
----------------------------

In fact, we could even use the `geo_bounds` aggregation inside each geohash
cell,((("geohash cells, geo_bounds aggregation in"))) in case the geo-points inside a cell are clustered in just a part of the
cell:

[source,json]
----------------------------
GET /attractions/restaurant/_search
{
  "size" : 0,
  "query": {
    "constant_score": {
      "filter": {
        "geo_bounding_box": {
          "location": {
            "top_left": {
              "lat":  40,8,
              "lon": -74.1
            },
            "bottom_right": {
              "lat":  40.4,
              "lon": -73.9
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "new_york": {
      "geohash_grid": {
        "field":     "location",
        "precision": 5
      },
      "aggs": {
        "cell": { <1>
          "geo_bounds": {
            "field": "location"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----------------------------
<1> The `cell_bounds` sub-aggregation is calculated for every geohash cell.

Now the ((("cell_bounds aggregation")))points in each cell have a bounding box:

[source,json]
----------------------------
...
"aggregations": {
  "new_york": {
     "buckets": [
        {
           "key": "dr5rs",
           "doc_count": 2,
           "cell": {
              "bounds": {
                 "top_left": {
                    "lat":  40.722,
                    "lon": -73.989
                 },
                 "bottom_right": {
                    "lat":  40.719,
                    "lon": -73.983
                 }
              }
           }
        },
...
----------------------------
