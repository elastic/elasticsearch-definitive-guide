=== Restoring from a Snapshot

Once you've backed up some data, restoring it is easy: simply add `_restore`
to the ID of((("post-deployment", "restoring from a snapshot")))((("restoring from a snapshot"))) the snapshot you wish to restore into your cluster:

[source,js]
----
POST _snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
----

The default behavior is to restore all indices that exist in that snapshot.
If `snapshot_1` contains five indices, all five will be restored into
our cluster. ((("indices", "restoring from a snapshot"))) As with the `snapshot` API, it is possible to select which indices
we want to restore.

There are also additional options for renaming indices.  This allows you to
match index names with a pattern, and then provide a new name during the restore process.
This is useful if you want to restore old data to verify its contents, or perform
some other processing, without replacing existing data.  Let's restore
a single index from the snapshot and provide a replacement name:

[source,js]
----
POST /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
{
    "indices": "index_1", <1>
    "rename_pattern": "index_(.+)", <2>
    "rename_replacement": "restored_index_$1" <3>
}
----
<1> Restore only the `index_1` index, ignoring the rest that are present in the
snapshot.
<2> Find any indices being restored that match the provided pattern.
<3> Then rename them with the replacement pattern.

This will restore `index_1` into your cluster, but rename it to `restored_index_1`.

[TIP]
==================================================

Similar to snapshotting, the `restore` command will return immediately, and the
restoration process will happen in the background.  If you would prefer your HTTP
call to block until the restore is finished, simply add the `wait_for_completion`
flag:

[source,js]
----
POST _snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore?wait_for_completion=true
----

==================================================


==== Monitoring Restore Operations

The restoration of data from a repository piggybacks on the existing recovery
mechanisms already in place in Elasticsearch.((("restoring from a snapshot", "monitoring restore operations")))  Internally, recovering shards
from a repository is identical to recovering from another node.

If you wish to monitor the progress of a restore, you can use the `recovery`
API.  This is a general-purpose API that shows the status of shards moving around
your cluster.

The API can be invoked for the specific indices that you are recovering:

[source,js]
----
GET /_recovery/restored_index_3
----

Or for all indices in your cluster, which may include other shards moving around,
unrelated to your restore process:

[source,js]
----
GET /_recovery/
----

The output will look similar to this (and note, it can become very verbose
depending on the activity of your cluster!):

[source,js]
----
{
  "restored_index_3" : {
    "shards" : [ {
      "id" : 0,
      "type" : "snapshot", <1>
      "stage" : "index",
      "primary" : true,
      "start_time" : "2014-02-24T12:15:59.716",
      "stop_time" : 0,
      "total_time_in_millis" : 175576,
      "source" : { <2>
        "repository" : "my_backup",
        "snapshot" : "snapshot_3",
        "index" : "restored_index_3"
      },
      "target" : {
        "id" : "ryqJ5lO5S4-lSFbGntkEkg",
        "hostname" : "my.fqdn",
        "ip" : "10.0.1.7",
        "name" : "my_es_node"
      },
      "index" : {
        "files" : {
          "total" : 73,
          "reused" : 0,
          "recovered" : 69,
          "percent" : "94.5%" <3>
        },
        "bytes" : {
          "total" : 79063092,
          "reused" : 0,
          "recovered" : 68891939,
          "percent" : "87.1%"
        },
        "total_time_in_millis" : 0
      },
      "translog" : {
        "recovered" : 0,
        "total_time_in_millis" : 0
      },
      "start" : {
        "check_index_time" : 0,
        "total_time_in_millis" : 0
      }
    } ]
  }
}
----
<1> The `type` field tells you the nature of the recovery; this shard is being
recovered from a snapshot.
<2> The `source` hash describes the particular snapshot and repository that is
being recovered from.
<3> The `percent` field gives you an idea about the status of the recovery.
This particular shard has recovered 94% of the files so far; it is almost complete.

The output will list all indices currently undergoing a recovery, and then
list all shards in each of those indices.  Each shard will have stats
about start/stop time, duration, recover percentage, bytes transferred, and more.

==== Canceling a Restore

To cancel a restore, you need to delete the indices being restored.((("restoring from a snapshot", "canceling a restore")))  Because
a restore process is really just shard recovery, issuing a `delete-index` API
alters the cluster state, which will in turn halt recovery.  For example:

[source,js]
----
DELETE /restored_index_3
----

If `restored_index_3` was actively being restored, this delete command would
halt the restoration as well as deleting any data that had already been restored
into the cluster.
