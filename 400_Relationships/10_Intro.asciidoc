== Handling relationships

In the real world, relationships matter: blogposts have comments, bank
accounts have transactions, customers have bank accounts, orders have order
lines, directories have files and sub-directories...

Relational databases are specifically designed -- and this will not come as a
surpise to you -- to manage relationships:

*   Each entity (or _row_, in the relational world) can be uniquely identified
    by a _primary key_.

*   Entities are _normalized_. The data for a unique entity is stored only
    once, and related entities store just its primary key. Changing the data of
    an entity only has to happen in one place.

*   Entities can be joined at query time, allowing for cross-entity search.

*   Changes to a single entity are _atomic_, _consistent_, _isolated_, and
    _durable_.  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_transactions[_ACID Transactions_]
    for more on this subject.)

*   Most relational databases support ACID transactions across multiple
    entities.

But relational databases do have their limitations, besides their poor support
for full text search.  Joining entities at query time is expensive -- the more
joins that are required, the more expensive the query.  Performing joins
between entities that live on different hardware is so expensive that it is
just not practical. This places a limit on the amount of data that can be
stored on a single server.

Elasticsearch, like most NoSQL databases, treats the world as though it were
flat. An index is a flat collection of independent documents. A single
document should contain all of the information that is required to decide
whether it matches a search request or not.

While changing the data of a single document in Elasticsearch is
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_transactions[ACIDic], transactions
involving multiple documents are not.  There is no way to roll back the index
to its previous state if part of a transaction fails.

This FlatWorld has its advantages:

*  Indexing is fast and lock-free.
*  Searching is fast and lock-free.
*  Massive amounts of data can be spread across multiple nodes, because each
   document is independent of the others.

But relationships matter.  Somehow, we need to bridge the gap between
FlatWorld and the real world. There are four common techniques used to manage
relational data in Elasticsearch, which we will be discussing:

* <<application-joins,Application-side joins>>.
* <<denormalization,Data denormalization>>.
* <<nested-objects,Nested objects>>.
* <<parent-child,Parent/Child relationships>>.

Often the final solution will require a mixture of a few of these techniques.
