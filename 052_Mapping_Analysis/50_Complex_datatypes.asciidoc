=== Complex Core Field Types

Besides the simple scalar datatypes that we have mentioned,((("data types", "complex core field types")))((("JSON", "datatypes", "complex"))) JSON also
has `null` values, arrays, and objects, all of which are supported by
Elasticsearch.

==== Multivalue Fields

It is quite possible that we want our `tag` field ((("fields", "multi-value")))to contain more
than one tag. Instead of a single string, we could index an array of tags:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{ "tag": [ "search", "nosql" ]}
--------------------------------------------------


There is no special mapping required for arrays.((("arrays"))) Any field can contain zero,
one, or more values, in the same way as a full-text field is analyzed to
produce multiple terms.

By implication, this means that _all the values of an array must be
of the same datatype_.  You can't mix dates with strings. If you create
a new field by indexing an array, Elasticsearch will use the
datatype of the first value in the array to determine the `type` of the
new field.

[NOTE]
====
When you get a document back from Elasticsearch, any arrays will be in the
same order as when you indexed the document.  The `_source` field that you get
back contains exactly the same JSON document that you indexed.

However, arrays are _indexed_&#x2014;made searchable--as multivalue fields,
which are unordered. ((("indexing", "of arrays")))((("arrays", "indexed as multi-value fields"))) At search time, you can't refer to ``the first element''
or ``the last element.''  Rather, think of an array as a _bag of values_.
((("arrays", "empty")))
====

==== Empty Fields

Arrays can, of course, be empty. ((("fields", "empty")))This is the equivalent of having zero
values. In fact, there is no way of storing a `null` value in Lucene, so
a field with a `null` value is also considered to be an empty
field.((("null values", "empty fields as")))

These three fields would all be considered to be empty, and would not be
indexed:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"null_value":               null,
"empty_array":              [],
"array_with_null_value":    [ null ]
--------------------------------------------------

[[inner-objects]]
==== Multilevel Objects

The last native JSON datatype that we need to ((("objects")))discuss is the _object_
-- known in other languages as a hash, hashmap, dictionary or
associative array.

_Inner objects_ are often used((("objects", "inner objects")))((("inner objects"))) to embed one entity or object inside
another. For instance, instead of having fields called `user_name`
and `user_id` inside our `tweet` document, we could write it as follows:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "tweet":            "Elasticsearch is very flexible",
    "user": {
        "id":           "@johnsmith",
        "gender":       "male",
        "age":          26,
        "name": {
            "full":     "John Smith",
            "first":    "John",
            "last":     "Smith"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------


==== Mapping for Inner Objects

Elasticsearch will detect new object fields((("mapping (types)", "inner objects")))((("inner objects", "mapping for"))) dynamically and map them as
type `object`, with each inner field listed under `properties`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "gb": {
    "tweet": { <1>
      "properties": {
        "tweet":            { "type": "string" },
        "user": { <2>
          "type":             "object",
          "properties": {
            "id":           { "type": "string" },
            "gender":       { "type": "string" },
            "age":          { "type": "long"   },
            "name":   { <2>
              "type":         "object",
              "properties": {
                "full":     { "type": "string" },
                "first":    { "type": "string" },
                "last":     { "type": "string" }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Root object
<2> Inner objects

The mapping for the `user` and `name` fields has a similar structure
to the mapping for the `tweet` type itself.  In fact, the `type` mapping
is just a special type of `object` mapping, which we refer to as the
_root object_.  ((("root object")))It is just the same as any other object, except that it has
some special top-level fields for document metadata, such as `_source`,
and the `_all` field.

==== How Inner Objects are Indexed

Lucene doesn't understand inner objects.((("indexing", "of inner objects")))((("inner objects", "indexing of"))) A Lucene document consists of a flat
list of key-value pairs.  In order for Elasticsearch to index inner objects
usefully, it converts our document into something like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "tweet":            [elasticsearch, flexible, very],
    "user.id":          [@johnsmith],
    "user.gender":      [male],
    "user.age":         [26],
    "user.name.full":   [john, smith],
    "user.name.first":  [john],
    "user.name.last":   [smith]
}
--------------------------------------------------


_Inner fields_ can be referred to by((("inner fields"))) name (for example, `first`). To distinguish
between two fields that have the same name, we can use the full _path_ (for example, `user.name.first`) or even the `type` name plus
the path (`tweet.user.name.first`).

NOTE: In the preceding simple flattened document, there is no field called `user`
and no field called `user.name`.  Lucene indexes only scalar or simple values,
not complex data structures.

[[object-arrays]]
==== Arrays of Inner Objects

Finally, consider how an array containing((("arrays", "of inner objects")))((("inner objects", "arrays of"))) inner objects would be indexed.
Let's say we have a `followers` array that looks like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "followers": [
        { "age": 35, "name": "Mary White"},
        { "age": 26, "name": "Alex Jones"},
        { "age": 19, "name": "Lisa Smith"}
    ]
}
--------------------------------------------------


This document will be flattened as we described previously, but the result will
look like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "followers.age":    [19, 26, 35],
    "followers.name":   [alex, jones, lisa, smith, mary, white]
}
--------------------------------------------------


The correlation between `{age: 35}` and `{name: Mary White}` has been lost as
each multivalue field is just a bag of values, not an ordered array.  This is
sufficient for us to ask, "Is there a follower who is 26 years old?"

But we can't get an accurate answer to this: "Is there a follower who is 26 years old _and who is called Alex Jones_?"

Correlated inner objects, which are able to answer queries like these,
are called _nested_ objects, and we cover them later, in
<<nested-objects>>.
