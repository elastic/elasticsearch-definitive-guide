== Mapping and analysis

While playing around with the data in our index, we notice something odd.
Something seems to be broken: we have 12 tweets in our indices, and only one
of them contains the date `2014-09-15`, but have a look at the `total` hits
for the following queries:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search?q=2014              # 12 results
GET /_search?q=2014-09-15        # 12 results !
GET /_search?q=date:2014-09-15   # 1  result
GET /_search?q=date:2014         # 0  results !
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 052_Mapping_Analysis/25_Data_type_differences.json

Why does querying the <<all-field-intro,`_all` field>> for the full date
return all tweets, and querying the `date` field for just the year return no
results? Why do our results differ when searching within the `_all` field or
the `date` field?

Presumably it is because the way our data has been indexed in the `_all`
field is different to how it has been indexed in the `date` field.
So let's take a look at how Elasticsearch has interpreted our document
structure, by requesting the _mapping_ (or schema definition)
for the `tweet` type in the `gb` index:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /gb/tweet/_mapping
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 052_Mapping_Analysis/25_Data_type_differences.json


which gives us:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "gb": {
      "mappings": {
         "tweet": {
            "properties": {
               "date": {
                  "type": "date",
                  "format": "dateOptionalTime"
               },
               "name": {
                  "type": "string"
               },
               "tweet": {
                  "type": "string"
               },
               "user_id": {
                  "type": "long"
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------


Elasticsearch has dynamically generated a mapping for us, based on what it
could guess about our field types. The response shows us that the `date` field
has been recognised as a field of type `date`. The `_all` field isn't
mentioned because it is a default field, but we know that the `_all` field is
of type `string`.

So fields of type `date` and fields of type `string` are indexed differently,
and can thus be searched differently.  That's not entirely surprising.
You might expect that each of the core data types -- strings, numbers, booleans
and dates -- might be indexed slightly differently. And this is true:
there are slight differences.

But by far the biggest difference is actually between fields that represent
_exact values_ (which can include `string` fields) and fields that
represent _full text_. This distinction is really important -- it's the thing
that separates a search engine from all other databases.
