=== What is relevance?

When searching, documents are returned in a particular order.  They
could be sorted on the `last_modified` time, but the default is to sort
them from most relevant to least relevant. This relevance value is called
the `_score`.

Each query clause generates a `_score` which is combined with the
scores from other query clauses to calculate the final `_score`.
Each type of query clause can calculate
its score in a different way depending on its purpose.

Typical factors that are taken into account with full text search are:

Term frequency::
  How often does each term appear in the field? The more often, the more
  relevant.

Inverse document frequency::
  How often does each term appear in the index?  The more often, the *less*
  relevant.

Length norm::
  How long is the field? The longer it is, the less likely it is to be
  relevant.

We will discuss how relevance is calculated in more detail in <<boost>>.
