[[decay-functions]]
=== The closer, the better

There are many variables that could influence the user's choice of holiday
home.  Maybe they would like to be close to the centre of town, but perhaps
they would be willing to settle for a place which is a bit further from the
centre if the price is low enough.  Perhaps the reverse is true: they would be
willing to pay more for the best location.

If we were to add a filter which excluded any holiday homes further than 1
kilometre from the center, or any holiday homes that cost more than £100 a
night, we might exclude results that the user would consider to be a good
compromise.

The `function_score` query gives us the ability to trade off one sliding scale
(like location) against another sliding scale (like price), with a group of
functions known as the _decay functions_.

There are three decay functions, called `linear`, `exp` and `gauss`, which
operate on numeric fields, date fields or lat-lon geo-points.  All three take
the same parameters:

[horizontal]
`origin`::

    The ``central point'', or the best possible value for the field.
    Documents that fall at the `origin` will get a full `_score` of `1.0`.

`scale`::

    The rate of decay -- how quickly the `_score` should drop the further from
    the `origin` that a document lies, eg every £10 or every 100 metres.

`decay`::

    The `_score` that a document at `scale` distance from the `origin` should
    receive. Defaults to `0.5`.

`offset`::

    Setting a non-zero `offset` expands the ``central point'' to cover a range
    of values instead of just the single point specified by the `origin`. All
    values in the range `-offset <= origin <= +offset` will receive the full
    `_score` of `1.0`.

The only difference between these three functions is the shape of the decay
curve. The difference is most easily illustrated with a graph:

[[img-decay-functions]]
.Decay function curves
image::images/170_07_decay.png["The curves of the decay functions"]

The curves shown in <<img-decay-functions>> all have their `origin` -- the
central point -- set to `40`.  The `offset` is `5`, meaning that all values in
the range `40 - 5 <= value <= 40 + 5` are treated as though they were at the
`origin` -- they all get the full score of `1.0`.

Outside of this range, the score starts to decay.  The rate of decay is
determined by the `scale` which, in this example, is set to `5`, and the
`decay` which is set to the default of `0.5`. The result is that all three
curves return a score of `0.5` at `origin +/- (offset + scale)`, or at points
`30` and `50`.

The difference between them is the shape of the curve at other points in the range:

* The `linear` funtion is just a straight line. Once the line hits zero,
  all values outside the line will return a score of `0.0`.
* The `exp` (exponential) function decays rapidly, then slows down.
* The `gauss` (Gaussian) function is bell-shaped -- it decays slowly, then
  rapidly, then slowing down again.

Which curve you choose depends entirely on how quickly you want the `_score`
to decay, the further a value is from the `origin`.

To return to our example: our user would prefer to rent a holiday home close
to the centre of London (`{ "lat": 51.50, "lon": 0.12}`) and to pay no more
than £100 a night, but our user considers price to be more important than
distance.   We could write this query as:

[source,json]
----------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "functions": [
        {
          "gauss": {
            "location": { <1>
              "origin": { "lat": 51.5, "lon": 0.12 },
              "offset": "2km",
              "scale":  "3km"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "gauss": {
            "price": { <2>
              "origin": "50", <3>
              "offset": "50",
              "scale":  "20"
            }
          },
          "weight": 2 <4>
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----------------------------------
<1> The `location` field is mapped as a `geo_point`.
<2> The `price` field is numeric.
<3> See below for the reason why `origin` is `50` instead of `100`.
<4> The `price` clause has twice the ``weight'' of the `location` clause.

The `location` clause is easy to understand:

* We have specified an `origin` which corresponds to the centre of London.
* Any location within `2km` of the `origin` receives the full score of `1.0`.
* Locations more than `5km` (`offset + scale`) from the centre receive a score
of `0.5`.

The `price` clause is a little trickier.  The user's preferred price is
anything up to £100, but this example sets the origin to £50.  Prices can't be
negative, but the lower they are the better.  Really, any price between £0 and
£100 should be considered optimal.

If we were to set the `origin` to £100, then prices below £100 would receive a
lower score. Instead, we set both the `origin` and the `offset` to £50.  That
way, the score only decays for any prices above £100 (`origin + offset`).

.Tuning `function_score` clauses
********************************************

The `weight` parameter can be used to increase or decrease the contribution of
individual clauses.  The `weight`, which defaults to `1.0`, is multiplied with
the score from each clause before the scores are combined with the specified
`score_mode`.
