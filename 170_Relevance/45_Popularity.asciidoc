=== Boosting by Popularity

Imagine that we have a website that hosts blog posts and enables users to vote for the
blog posts that they like.((("relevance", "controlling", "boosting by popularity")))((("popularity", "boosting by")))((("boosting", "by popularity"))) We would like more-popular posts to appear higher in the
results list, but still have the full-text score as the main relevance driver.
We can do this easily by storing the number of votes with each blog post:

[role="pagebreak-before"]
[source,json]
-------------------------------
PUT /blogposts/post/1
{
  "title":   "About popularity",
  "content": "In this post we will talk about...",
  "votes":   6
}
-------------------------------

At search time, we can use the `function_score` query ((("function_score query", "field_value_factor function")))((("field_value_factor function")))with the
`field_value_factor` function to combine the number of votes with the full-text relevance score:

[source,json]
-------------------------------
GET /blogposts/post/_search
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": { <1>
      "query": { <2>
        "multi_match": {
          "query":    "popularity",
          "fields": [ "title", "content" ]
        }
      },
      "field_value_factor": { <3>
        "field": "votes" <4>
      }
    }
  }
}
-------------------------------
<1> The `function_score` query wraps the main query and the function we would
    like to apply.
<2> The main query is executed first.
<3> The `field_value_factor` function is applied to every document matching
    the main `query`.
<4> Every document _must_ have a number in the `votes` field for
    the `function_score` to work.  If every document does _not_ have a number in the `votes` field, then you _must_ use the
    {ref}/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#function-field-value-factor[`missing` property] to provide a default value for the score calculation.

In the preceding example, the final `_score` for each document has been altered as
follows:

    new_score = old_score * number_of_votes

This will not give us great results.  The full-text `_score` range
usually falls somewhere between 0 and 10. As can be seen in <<img-popularity-linear>>, a blog post with 10 votes will
completely swamp the effect of the full-text score, and a blog post with 0
votes will reset the score to zero.

==== modifier

A better way to incorporate popularity is to smooth out the `votes` value
with some `modifier`.  ((("modifier parameter")))((("field_value_factor function", "modifier parameter")))In other words, we want the first few votes to count a
lot, but for each subsequent vote to count less.  The difference between 0
votes and 1 vote should be much bigger than the difference between 10 votes
and 11 votes.

A typical `modifier` for this use case is `log1p`, which changes the formula
to the following:

    new_score = old_score * log(1 + number_of_votes)

The `log` function smooths out the effect of the `votes` field to provide a
curve like the one in <<img-popularity-log>>.

[[img-popularity-log]]

The request with the `modifier` parameter looks like the following:

[source,json]
-------------------------------
GET /blogposts/post/_search
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "multi_match": {
          "query":    "popularity",
          "fields": [ "title", "content" ]
        }
      },
      "field_value_factor": {
        "field":    "votes",
        "modifier": "log1p" <1>
      }
    }
  }
}
-------------------------------
<1> Set the `modifier` to `log1p`.

[role="pagebreak-before"]
The available modifiers are `none` (the default), `log`, `log1p`, `log2p`,
`ln`, `ln1p`, `ln2p`, `square`, `sqrt`,  and `reciprocal`.  You can read more
about them in the
{ref}/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#function-field-value-factor[`field_value_factor` documentation].

==== factor

The strength of the popularity effect can be increased or decreased by
multiplying the value((("factor (function_score)")))((("field_value_factor function", "factor parameter"))) in the `votes` field by some number, called the
`factor`:

[source,json]
-------------------------------
GET /blogposts/post/_search
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "multi_match": {
          "query":    "popularity",
          "fields": [ "title", "content" ]
        }
      },
      "field_value_factor": {
        "field":    "votes",
        "modifier": "log1p",
        "factor":   2 <1>
      }
    }
  }
}
-------------------------------
<1> Doubles the popularity effect

Adding in a `factor` changes the formula to this:

    new_score = old_score * log(1 + factor * number_of_votes)

A `factor` greater than `1` increases the effect, and a `factor` less than `1`
decreases the effect, as shown in <<img-popularity-factor>>.

==== boost_mode

Perhaps multiplying the full-text score by the result of the
`field_value_factor` function ((("function_score query", "boost_mode parameter")))((("boost_mode parameter")))still has too large an effect.  We can control
how the result of a function is combined with the `_score` from the query by
using the `boost_mode` parameter, which accepts the following values:

`multiply`::
      Multiply the `_score` with the function result (default)

`sum`::
      Add the function result to the `_score`

`min`::
      The lower of the `_score` and the function result

`max`::
      The higher of the `_score` and the function result

`replace`::
      Replace the `_score` with the function result

If, instead of multiplying, we add the function result to the `_score`, we can
achieve a much smaller effect, especially if we use a low `factor`:

[source,json]
-------------------------------
GET /blogposts/post/_search
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "multi_match": {
          "query":    "popularity",
          "fields": [ "title", "content" ]
        }
      },
      "field_value_factor": {
        "field":    "votes",
        "modifier": "log1p",
        "factor":   0.1
      },
      "boost_mode": "sum" <1>
    }
  }
}
-------------------------------
<1> Add the function result to the `_score`.

The formula for the preceding request now looks like this (see <<img-popularity-sum>>):

    new_score = old_score + log(1 + 0.1 * number_of_votes)

==== max_boost

Finally, we can cap the maximum effect((("function_score query", "max_boost parameter")))((("max_boost parameter"))) that the function can have by using the
`max_boost` parameter:

[source,json]
-------------------------------
GET /blogposts/post/_search
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "multi_match": {
          "query":    "popularity",
          "fields": [ "title", "content" ]
        }
      },
      "field_value_factor": {
        "field":    "votes",
        "modifier": "log1p",
        "factor":   0.1
      },
      "boost_mode": "sum",
      "max_boost":  1.5 <1>
    }
  }
}
-------------------------------
<1> Whatever the result of the `field_value_factor` function, it will never be
    greater than `1.5`.

NOTE: The `max_boost` applies a limit to the result of the function only, not
to the final `_score`.
