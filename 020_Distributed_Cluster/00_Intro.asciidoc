Elasticsearch is built to be always available, and to scale with your needs.
Scale can come from buying bigger servers (_vertical scale_ or _scaling up_)
or from buying more servers (_horizontal scale_ or _scaling out_).

While Elasticsearch can benefit from more powerful hardware, vertical scale
has its limits. Real scalability comes from horizontal scale -- the ability to
add more nodes to the cluster and to spread load and reliability between them.

With most databases, scaling horizontally usually requires a major overhaul of
your application to take advantage of these extra boxes. In contrast,
Elasticsearch is _distributed_ by nature. It knows how to manage multiple
nodes to provide scale and high availability.  This also means that your
application doesn't need to care about it.

In this chapter we are going to look at how a cluster uses nodes and shards to
scale with your needs and to ensure that your data is safe from hardware
failure.
