=== Cluster Health

Many statistics can be monitored in an Elasticsearch cluster,
but the single most important((("cluster health"))) one is _cluster health_, which reports a
`status` of either `green`, `yellow`, or `red`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/health
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 020_Distributed_Cluster/10_Cluster_health.json

On an empty cluster with no indices, this will return something like the following:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "cluster_name": "my_cluster",
  "status": "green", <1>
  "timed_out": false,
  "number_of_nodes": 1,
  "number_of_data_nodes": 1,
  "active_primary_shards": 0,
  "active_shards": 0,
  "relocating_shards": 0,
  "initializing_shards": 0,
  "unassigned_shards": 0,
  "delayed_unassigned_shards": 0,
  "number_of_pending_tasks": 0,
  "number_of_in_flight_fetch": 0,
  "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis": 0,
  "active_shards_percent_as_number": 100
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `status` field is the one we're most interested in.

The `status` field provides ((("status field")))an overall indication of how the cluster is
functioning. The meanings of the three colors are provided here for reference:

`green`::
   All primary and replica shards are active.

 `yellow`::
   All primary shards are active, but not all replica shards are active.

 `red`::
   Not all primary shards are active.

In the rest of this chapter, we explain what _primary_ and _replica_ shards are
and explain the practical implications of each of the preceding colors.
