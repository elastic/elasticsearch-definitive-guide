=== Index Settings

There are many many knobs((("index settings"))) that you can twiddle to
customize index behavior, which you can read about in the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html[Index Modules reference documentation],
but...

TIP: Elasticsearch comes with good defaults. Don't twiddle these knobs until
you understand what they do and why you should change them.

Two of the most important((("shards", "number_of_shards index setting")))((("number_of_shards setting")))((("index settings", "number_of_shards"))) settings are as follows:

`number_of_shards`::

    The number of primary shards that an index should have,
    which defaults to `5`.  This setting cannot be changed
    after index creation.

`number_of_replicas`::

    The number of replica shards (copies) that each primary shard
    should have, which defaults to `1`.  This setting can be changed
    at any time on a live index.

For instance, we could create a small index--just((("index settings", "number_of_replicas")))((("replica shards", "number_of_replicas index setting"))) one primary shard--and no replica shards with the following request:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /my_temp_index
{
    "settings": {
        "number_of_shards" :   1,
        "number_of_replicas" : 0
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 070_Index_Mgmt/10_Settings.json

Later, we can change the number of replica shards dynamically using the
`update-index-settings` API as((("update-index-settings API"))) follows:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /my_temp_index/_settings
{
    "number_of_replicas": 1
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 070_Index_Mgmt/10_Settings.json
