=== Reindexing Your Data

Although you can add new types to an index, or add new fields to a type, you
can't add new analyzers or make changes to existing fields.((("reindexing")))((("indexing", "reindexing your data")))  If you were to do
so, the data that had already been indexed would be incorrect and your
searches would no longer work as expected.

The simplest way to apply these changes to your existing data is to
reindex:  create a new index with the new settings and copy all of your
documents from the old index to the new index.

One of the advantages of the `_source` field is that you already have the
whole document available to you in Elasticsearch itself. You don't have to
rebuild your index from the database, which is usually much slower.

To reindex all of the documents from the old index efficiently,  use
<<scan-scroll,_scan-and-scroll_>> to retrieve batches((("scan-and-scroll", "using in reindexing documents"))) of documents from the old index,
and the <<bulk,`bulk` API>> to push them into the new index.

You can run multiple reindexing jobs at the same time, but you obviously don't
want their results to overlap.  Instead, break a big reindex down into smaller
jobs by filtering on a date or timestamp field:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /old_index/_search?search_type=scan&scroll=1m
{
    "query": {
        "range": {
            "date": {
                "gte":  "2014-01-01",
                "lt":   "2014-02-01"
            }
        }
    },
    "size":  1000
}
--------------------------------------------------


If you continue making changes to the old index, you will want to make
sure that you include the newly added documents in your new index as well.
This can be done by rerunning the reindex process, but again filtering
on a date field to match only documents that have been added since the
last reindex process started.
