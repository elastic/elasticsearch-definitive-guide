=== How primary and replica shards interact

For explanation purposes, let's imagine that we have a cluster
consisting of 3 nodes. It contains one index called `blogs` which has
two primary shards. Each primary shard has two replicas. Copies of
the same shard are never allocated to the same node, so our cluster
looks something like <<img-distrib>>.

We can send our requests to any node in the cluster. Every node is fully capable
of servicing any request.  If, for example, it requires data on another node,
it will transparently forward the request to the relevant node without any
intervention from the user.  In the examples below, we will send all of our
requests to `Node 1`, which we will refer to as  the _requesting node_.

TIP: When sending requests, it is good practice to round-robin through all the
nodes in the cluster, in order to spread the load.
