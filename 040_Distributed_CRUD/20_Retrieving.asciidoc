=== Retrieving a document

A document can be retrieved from a primary shard or from any of its replicas.

Below we list the sequence of steps to retrieve a document from either a
primary or replica shard, as depicted in <<img-distrib-read>>:

1. The client sends a get request to `Node 1`.

2. The node uses the document's `_id` to determine that the document
   belongs to shard `0`. Copies of shard `0` exist on all three nodes.
   On this occasion, it forwards the request to `Node 2`.

3. `Node 2` returns the document to `Node 1` which returns the document
   to the client.

For read requests, the requesting node will choose a different shard copy on
every request in order to balance the load -- it round-robins through all
shard copies.

It is possible that a document has been indexed on the primary shard but
has not yet been copied to the replica shards. In this case a replica
might report that the document doesn't exist, while the primary would have
returned the document successfully.

// I think it would be nice to mention, explain the "preference" parameter here.
// Or at least link to the "search options" section of the book where
// it is explained. It would be useful for the reader here and it is 
// also mentionned in the "multi-document pattern" section without being explained
// just after.
