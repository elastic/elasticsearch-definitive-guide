Queries are seldom simple one-clause `match` queries.  We frequently need to
search for the same or different query strings in one or more fields, which
means that we need to be able to combine multiple query clauses and their
relevance scores in a way that makes sense.

Perhaps we're looking for a book called ``War and Peace'' by an author called
``Fyodor Dostoevsky''. Perhaps we're searching the Elasticsearch documentation
for ``minimum should match'', which might be in the title or the body of a
page. Or perhaps we're searching for users with first name ``John'' and last
name ``Smith''.

In this chapter we will discuss the available tools for constructing multi-clause
searches and how to figure out which solution you should apply to your
particular use case.
