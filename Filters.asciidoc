== Query DSL - Filters

Filters answer `yes|no` questions -- a document either matches a filter, or it
doesn't. They are fast, efficient and cacheable, and should be used instead of
queries wherever possible.

A filter clause can be used wherever _filter context_ applies:

 * as the argument for any parameter in the Elasticsearch API called
   `filter` or `facet_filter`

 * in a compound filter clause (such as the <<bool_filter,`bool` filter>>)
   which expects one or more filter clauses

 * in any query clause which accepts a `filter` argument, such as the
   <<filtered_query,`filtered` query>>

In the rest of this chapter, we will discuss the most commonly used
filter clauses. We start with filters because they are simpler than queries
and can be used to express similar conditions to those supported in SQL.
