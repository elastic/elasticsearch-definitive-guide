=== Conclusion

By now you should have a taste of what you can do with Elasticsearch, and how
easy it is to get started. Elasticsearch tries hard to work out of the box
with minimal knowledge and configuration. The best way to learn Elasticsearch
is by jumping in: just start indexing and searching!

However, the more you know about Elasticsearch, the more productive you can
become.  The more you can tell Elasticsearch about the domain-specific
elements of your application, the more you can fine tune the output.

The rest of this book will help you move from novice to expert. Each chapter
will explain the essentials, but will also include expert-level tips.  If
you're just getting started, these tips are probably not immediately relevant
to you -- Elasticsearch has sensible defaults and will generally do the right
thing without any interference.  You can always revisit these chapters later,
when you are looking to improve performance by shaving off any wasted
milliseconds.
