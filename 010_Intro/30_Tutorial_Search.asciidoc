=== Retrieving a Document

Now that we have some data stored in Elasticsearch,((("documents", "retrieving"))) we can get to work on the
business requirements for this application.  The first requirement is the
ability to retrieve individual employee data.

This is easy in Elasticsearch.  We simply execute((("HTTP requests", "retrieving a document with GET"))) an HTTP +GET+ request and
specify the _address_ of the document--the index, type, and ID.((("id", "specifying in a request")))((("indices", "specifying index in a request")))((("types", "specifying type in a request")))  Using
those three pieces of information, we can return the original JSON document:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/1
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Get.json

And the response contains some metadata about the document, and John Smith's
original JSON document ((("_source field", sortas="source field")))as the `_source` field:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "_index" :   "megacorp",
  "_type" :    "employee",
  "_id" :      "1",
  "_version" : 1,
  "found" :    true,
  "_source" :  {
      "first_name" :  "John",
      "last_name" :   "Smith",
      "age" :         25,
      "about" :       "I love to go rock climbing",
      "interests":  [ "sports", "music" ]
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

[TIP]
====
In the same way that we changed ((("HTTP methods")))the HTTP verb from `PUT` to `GET` in order to
retrieve the document, we could use the `DELETE` verb to delete the  document,
and the `HEAD` verb to check whether the document exists. To replace an
existing document with an updated version, we just `PUT` it again.

=== Search Lite

A `GET` is fairly simple--you get back the document that you ask for.((("GET method")))((("searches", "simple search")))  Let's
try something a little more advanced, like a simple search!

The first search we will try is the simplest search possible.  We will search
for all employees, with this request:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Simple_search.json

You can see that we're still using index `megacorp` and type `employee`, but
instead of specifying a document ID, we now use the `_search` endpoint. The
response includes all three of our documents in the `hits` array. By default,
a search will return the top 10 results.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "took":      6,
   "timed_out": false,
   "_shards": { ... },
   "hits": {
      "total":      3,
      "max_score":  1,
      "hits": [
         {
            "_index":         "megacorp",
            "_type":          "employee",
            "_id":            "3",
            "_score":         1,
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "Douglas",
               "last_name":   "Fir",
               "age":         35,
               "about":       "I like to build cabinets",
               "interests": [ "forestry" ]
            }
         },
         {
            "_index":         "megacorp",
            "_type":          "employee",
            "_id":            "1",
            "_score":         1,
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "John",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         25,
               "about":       "I love to go rock climbing",
               "interests": [ "sports", "music" ]
            }
         },
         {
            "_index":         "megacorp",
            "_type":          "employee",
            "_id":            "2",
            "_score":         1,
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "Jane",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         32,
               "about":       "I like to collect rock albums",
               "interests": [ "music" ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The response not only tells us which documents matched, but also
includes the whole document itself: all the information that we need in order to
display the search results to the user.

Next, let's try searching for employees who have ``Smith'' in their last name.
To do this, we'll use a _lightweight_ search method that is easy to use
from the command line. This method is often referred to as ((("query strings")))a _query-string_
search, since we pass the search as a URL query-string parameter:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search?q=last_name:Smith
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Simple_search.json

We use the same `_search` endpoint in the path, and we add the query itself in
the `q=` parameter. The results that come back show all Smiths:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "hits": {
      "total":      2,
      "max_score":  0.30685282,
      "hits": [
         {
            ...
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "John",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         25,
               "about":       "I love to go rock climbing",
               "interests": [ "sports", "music" ]
            }
         },
         {
            ...
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "Jane",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         32,
               "about":       "I like to collect rock albums",
               "interests": [ "music" ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------

=== Search with Query DSL

Query-string search is handy for ad hoc searches((("ad hoc searches"))) from the command line, but
it has its limitations (see <<search-lite>>). Elasticsearch provides a rich,
flexible, query language called the _query DSL_, which((("Query DSL"))) allows us to build
much more complicated, robust queries.

The _domain-specific language_ (DSL) is((("DSL (Domain Specific Language)"))) specified using a JSON request body.
We can represent the previous search for all Smiths like so:


[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "last_name" : "Smith"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Simple_search.json

This will return the same results as the previous query.  You can see that a
number of things have changed.  For one, we are no longer using _query-string_
parameters, but instead a request body.  This request body is built with JSON,
and uses a `match` query (one of several types of queries, which we will learn
about later).

=== More-Complicated Searches

Let's make the search a little more complicated.((("searches", "more complicated")))((("filters")))  We still want to find all
employees with a last name of Smith, but  we want only employees who are
older than 30.  Our query will change a little to accommodate a _filter_,
which allows us to execute structured searches efficiently:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "filtered" : {
            "filter" : {
                "range" : {
                    "age" : { "gt" : 30 } <1>
                }
            },
            "query" : {
                "match" : {
                    "last_name" : "smith" <2>
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Query_DSL.json

<1> This portion of the query is a `range` _filter_, which((("range filters"))) will find all ages
    older than 30&#x2014;`gt` stands for _greater than_.
<2> This portion of the query is the((("match queries"))) same `match` _query_ that we used before.

Don't worry about the syntax too much for now; we will cover it in great
detail later.  Just recognize that we've added a _filter_ that performs a
range search, and reused the same `match` query as before.  Now our results show only one employee who happens to be 32 and is named Jane Smith:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "hits": {
      "total":      1,
      "max_score":  0.30685282,
      "hits": [
         {
            ...
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "Jane",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         32,
               "about":       "I like to collect rock albums",
               "interests": [ "music" ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------

=== Full-Text Search

The searches so far have been simple:  single names, filtered by age. Let's
try a more advanced, full-text search--a ((("full text search")))task that traditional databases
would really struggle with.

We are going to search for all employees who enjoy rock climbing:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "about" : "rock climbing"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Query_DSL.json

You can see that we use the same `match` query as before to search the `about`
field for ``rock climbing.'' We get back two matching documents:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "hits": {
      "total":      2,
      "max_score":  0.16273327,
      "hits": [
         {
            ...
            "_score":         0.16273327, <1>
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "John",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         25,
               "about":       "I love to go rock climbing",
               "interests": [ "sports", "music" ]
            }
         },
         {
            ...
            "_score":         0.016878016, <1>
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "Jane",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         32,
               "about":       "I like to collect rock albums",
               "interests": [ "music" ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The relevance scores

By default, Elasticsearch sorts((("relevance scores"))) matching results by their relevance score,
that is, by how well each document matches the query.  The first and highest-scoring result is obvious: John Smith's `about` field clearly says ``rock
climbing'' in it.

But why did Jane Smith come back as a result?  The reason her document was
returned is because the word ``rock'' was mentioned in her `about` field.
Because only ``rock'' was mentioned, and not ``climbing,'' her `_score` is
lower than John's.

This is a good example of how Elasticsearch can search _within_ full-text
fields and return the most relevant results first. This ((("relevance", "importance to Elasticsearch")))concept of _relevance_
is important to Elasticsearch, and is a concept that is completely foreign to
traditional relational databases, in which a record either matches or it doesn't.

=== Phrase Search

Finding individual words in a field is all well and good, but sometimes you
want to match exact sequences of words or _phrases_.((("phrase matching"))) For instance, we could
perform a query that will match only employee records that contain both  ``rock''
_and_ ``climbing'' _and_ that display the words are next to each other in the phrase
``rock climbing.''

To do this, we use a slight variation of the `match` query called the
`match_phrase` query:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "match_phrase" : {
            "about" : "rock climbing"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Query_DSL.json

This, to no surprise, returns only John Smith's document:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "hits": {
      "total":      1,
      "max_score":  0.23013961,
      "hits": [
         {
            ...
            "_score":         0.23013961,
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "John",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         25,
               "about":       "I love to go rock climbing",
               "interests": [ "sports", "music" ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------

[[highlighting-intro]]
=== Highlighting Our Searches

Many applications like to _highlight_ snippets((("searches", "highlighting search results")))((("highlighting searches"))) of text from each search result
so the user can see _why_ the document matched the query.  Retrieving
highlighted fragments is easy in Elasticsearch.

Let's rerun our previous query, but add a new `highlight` parameter:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
    "query" : {
        "match_phrase" : {
            "about" : "rock climbing"
        }
    },
    "highlight": {
        "fields" : {
            "about" : {}
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/30_Query_DSL.json

When we run this query, the same hit is returned as before, but now we get a
new section in the response called `highlight`.  This contains a snippet of
text from the `about` field with the matching words wrapped in `<em></em>`
HTML tags:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "hits": {
      "total":      1,
      "max_score":  0.23013961,
      "hits": [
         {
            ...
            "_score":         0.23013961,
            "_source": {
               "first_name":  "John",
               "last_name":   "Smith",
               "age":         25,
               "about":       "I love to go rock climbing",
               "interests": [ "sports", "music" ]
            },
            "highlight": {
               "about": [
                  "I love to go <em>rock</em> <em>climbing</em>" <1>
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
