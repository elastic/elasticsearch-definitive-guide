=== Tutorial Conclusion

Hopefully, this little tutorial was a good demonstration about what is possible
in Elasticsearch.  It is really just scratching the surface, and many features--such as suggestions, geolocation, percolation, fuzzy and partial matching--were omitted to keep the tutorial short. But it did highlight just how
easy it is to start building advanced search functionality.  No configuration
was needed--just add data and start searching!

It's likely that the syntax left you confused in places, and you may have questions
about how to tweak and tune various aspects. That's fine! The rest of the
book dives into each of these issues in detail, giving you a solid
understanding of how Elasticsearch works.
