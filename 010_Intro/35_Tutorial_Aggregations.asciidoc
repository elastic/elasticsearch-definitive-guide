=== Analytics

Finally, we come to our last business requirement: allow managers to run
analytics over the employee directory.  Elasticsearch has functionality called
_aggregations_, which allows you to generate sophisticated analytics over your
data. It is similar to `GROUP BY` in SQL, but much more powerful.

For example, let's find the most popular interests enjoyed by our employees:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "all_interests": {
      "terms": { "field": "interests" }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/35_Aggregations.json

Ignore the syntax for now and just look at the results:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "hits": { ... },
   "aggregations": {
      "all_interests": {
         "buckets": [
            {
               "key":       "music",
               "doc_count": 2
            },
            {
               "key":       "forestry",
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key":       "sports",
               "doc_count": 1
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------

We can see that two employees are interested in music, one in forestry and one
in sports.  These aggregations are not precalculated -- they are generated on
the fly from the documents which match the current query. If we want to know
the popular interests of people called ``Smith'', we can just add the
appropriate query into the mix:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "last_name": "smith"
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "all_interests": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "interests"
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/35_Aggregations.json

The `all_interests` aggregation has changed to include only documents matching our query:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
  ...
  "all_interests": {
     "buckets": [
        {
           "key": "music",
           "doc_count": 2
        },
        {
           "key": "sports",
           "doc_count": 1
        }
     ]
  }
--------------------------------------------------

Aggregations allow hierarchical rollups too.  For example, let's find the
average age of employees who share a particular interest:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /megacorp/employee/_search
{
    "aggs" : {
        "all_interests" : {
            "terms" : { "field" : "interests" },
            "aggs" : {
                "avg_age" : {
                    "avg" : { "field" : "age" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 010_Intro/35_Aggregations.json

The aggregations that we get back are a bit more complicated, but still fairly
easy to understand:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
  ...
  "all_interests": {
     "buckets": [
        {
           "key": "music",
           "doc_count": 2,
           "avg_age": {
              "value": 28.5
           }
        },
        {
           "key": "forestry",
           "doc_count": 1,
           "avg_age": {
              "value": 35
           }
        },
        {
           "key": "sports",
           "doc_count": 1,
           "avg_age": {
              "value": 25
           }
        }
     ]
  }
--------------------------------------------------

The output is basically an enriched version of the first aggregation we ran.
We still have a list of interests and their counts, but now each interest has
an additional `avg_age` which shows the average age for all employees having
that interest.

Even if you don't understand the syntax yet, you can easily see how very
complex aggregations and groupings can be accomplished using this feature.
The sky is the limit as to what kind of data you can extract!
