=== Installing and Running Elasticsearch

The easiest way to understand what Elasticsearch can do for you is to
play with it, so let's get started!((("Elasticsearch", "installing")))

The only requirement for installing Elasticsearch is a recent version of Java.
Preferably, you should install the latest version of the((("Java", "installing"))) official Java
from http://www.java.com[_www.java.com_].

You can get the latest version of Elasticsearch from
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[_elasticsearch.co/downloads/elasticsearch_].

To install Elasticsearch, download and extract the archive file for your platform. For 
more information, see the {ref}/_installation.html[Installation] topic in the Elasticsearch 
Reference. 

[TIP]
====
When installing Elasticsearch in production, you can choose to use 
the Debian or RPM packages provided on the
http://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[downloads page]. You can also use
the officially supported
https://github.com/elasticsearch/puppet-elasticsearch[Puppet module] or
https://github.com/elasticsearch/cookbook-elasticsearch[Chef cookbook].
====


Once you've extracted the archive file, Elasticsearch is ready to run. ((("Elasticsearch", "running"))) To start it up in the foreground:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
cd elasticsearch-<version>
./bin/elasticsearch <1> <2>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Add `-d` if you want to run it in the background as a daemon.
<2> If you're running Elasticsearch on Windows, simply run `bin\elasticsearch.bat` instead.

Test it out by opening another terminal window and running the following:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
curl 'http://localhost:9200/?pretty'
--------------------------------------------------

TIP: If you're running Elasticsearch on Windows, you can download cURL from 
http://curl.haxx.se/download.html[`http://curl.haxx.se/download.html`]. cURL
provides a convenient way to submit requests to Elasticsearch and 
installing cURL enables you to copy and paste many of the examples in this
book to try them out.

You should see a response like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "name" : "Tom Foster",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "2.1.0",
    "build_hash" : "72cd1f1a3eee09505e036106146dc1949dc5dc87",
    "build_timestamp" : "2015-11-18T22:40:03Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "5.3.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
--------------------------------------------------

This means that you have an Elasticsearch node up and running, and you can
start experimenting with it. A _node_ is a running instance of Elasticsearch.
((("nodes", "defined"))) A _cluster_ is ((("clusters", "defined")))a group of
nodes with the same `cluster.name` that are working together to share data
and to provide failover and scale. (A single node, however, can form a cluster
all by itself.) You can change the `cluster.name` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration
file that's loaded when you start a node. More information about this and other
<<important-configuration-changes, Important Configuration Changes>> is provided
in the Production Deployment section at the end of this book.

TIP: See that View in Sense link at the bottom of the example? <<sense, Install the Sense console>>
to run the examples in this book against your own Elasticsearch cluster and view the results. 

When Elasticsearch is running in the foreground, you can stop it by pressing Ctrl-C.

[[sense]]
==== Installing Sense
Sense is a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana]
app ((("Sense console", "Kibana app"))) that provides an interactive
console for submitting requests to Elasticsearch directly from your browser.
Many of the code examples in the online version of this book include a View in Sense link. When
clicked, it opens up a working example of the code in the Sense console.
You do not have to install Sense, but it will make this book much more
interactive by allowing you to  experiment with the code samples on your local
Elasticsearch cluster.

((("Sense", "downloading and installing"))) To install and run Sense:

. Run the following command in the Kibana directory to download and install the Sense app:
+
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
./bin/kibana plugin --install elastic/sense <1>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Windows: `bin\kibana.bat plugin --install elastic/sense`.
+
NOTE: You can download Sense from https://download.elastic.co/elastic/sense/sense-latest.tar.gz
to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/sense/current/installing.html#manual_download[install it on an offline machine].

. Start Kibana.
+
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
./bin/kibana <1>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Windows: `bin\kibana.bat`. 

. Open Sense your web browser by going to `http://localhost:5601/app/sense`.
