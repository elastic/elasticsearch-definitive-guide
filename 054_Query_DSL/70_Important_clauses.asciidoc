=== Most important queries and filters

While Elasticsearch comes with many different queries and filters, there are
just a few which you will use frequently. We will discuss them in much greater
detail in <<search-in-depth>> but below we give you a quick introduction to
the most important queries and filters.

==== `term` filter

The `term` filter is used to filter by exact values, be they numbers, dates,
booleans, or `not_analyzed` exact value string fields:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{ "term": { "age":    26           }}
{ "term": { "date":   "2014-09-01" }}
{ "term": { "public": true         }}
{ "term": { "tag":    "full_text"  }}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Term_filter.json

==== `terms` filter

The `terms` filter is the same as the `term` filter, but allows you
to specify multiple values to match. If the field contains any of
the specified values, then the document matches:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{ "terms": { "tag": [ "search", "full_text", "nosql" ] }}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Terms_filter.json

==== `range` filter

The `range` filter allows you to find numbers or dates which fall into
the specified range:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "range": {
        "age": {
            "gte":  20,
            "lt":   30
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Range_filter.json

The operators that it accepts are:

[horizontal]
`gt` ::     greater than
`gte`::     greater than or equal to
`lt` ::     less than
`lte`::     less than or equal to


==== `exists` and `missing` filters

The `exists` and `missing` filters are used to find documents where
the specified field either has one or more values (`exists`) or doesn't have
any values (`missing`). It is similar in nature to `IS_NULL` in SQL:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "exists":   {
        "field":    "title"
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Exists_filter.json

These filters are frequently used to apply a condition only if a field is
present, and to apply a different condition if it is missing.

==== `bool` filter

The `bool` filter is used to combine multiple filter clauses using
Boolean logic.  It accepts three parameters:

[horizontal]
`must`      :: These clauses *must* match, like `and`
`must_not`  :: These clauses *must not* match, like `not`
`should`    :: At least one of these clauses must match, like `or`

Each of these parameters can accept a single filter clause or an array
of filter clauses:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "bool": {
        "must":     { "term": { "folder": "inbox" }},
        "must_not": { "term": { "tag":    "spam"  }},
        "should": [
                    { "term": { "starred": true   }},
                    { "term": { "unread":  true   }}
        ]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Bool_filter.json


==== `match_all` query

The `match_all` query simply matches all documents. It is the default
query which is used if no query has been specified.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{ "match_all": {}}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Match_all_query.json


This query is frequently used in combination with a filter, for instance to
retrieve all emails in the inbox folder. All documents are considered to be
equally relevant, so they all receive a neutral `_score` of `1`.

==== `match` query

The `match` query should be the standard query that you reach for whenever
you want to query for a full text or exact value in almost any field.

If you run a `match` query against a full text field, it will analyze
the query string using the correct analyzer for that field before executing
the search:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{ "match": { "tweet": "About Search" }}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Match_query.json

If you use it on a field containing an exact value, such as a number, a date,
a boolean or a `not_analyzed` string field, then it will search for that
exact value:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{ "match": { "age":    26           }}
{ "match": { "date":   "2014-09-01" }}
{ "match": { "public": true         }}
{ "match": { "tag":    "full_text"  }}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Match_query.json

TIP: For exact value searches, you probably want to use a filter instead of a
query, as a filter will be cached.

Unlike the query string search that we showed in <<search-lite>>, the `match`
query does not use a query syntax like `"+user_id:2 +tweet:search"`. It just
looks for the words that are specified. This means that it is safe to expose
to your users via a search field -- you control what fields they can query and
it is not prone to throwing syntax errors.

==== `multi_match` query

The `multi_match` query allows to run the same `match` query on multiple
fields:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "multi_match": {
        "query":    "full text search",
        "fields":   [ "title", "body" ]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Multi_match_query.json

==== `bool` query

The `bool` query, like the `bool` filter, is used to combine multiple
query clauses. However, there are some differences. Remember that while
filters give binary `yes|no` answers, queries calculate a relevance score
instead. The `bool` query combines the `_score` from each `must` or
`should` clause which matches.

[horizontal]
`must`::        Clauses which *must* match for the document to be included.

`must_not`::    Clauses which *must not* match for the document to be included.

`should`::      If these clauses match, then they increase the `_score`,
                otherwise they have no effect. They are simply used to refine
                the relevance score for each document.

The following query finds documents whose `title` field matches
the query string `"how to make millions"` and which are not marked
as `spam`.  If any documents are `"starred"` or are from 2014 onwards,
then they will rank higher than they would have otherwise. Documents which
match *both* conditions will rank even higher:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "bool": {
        "must":     { "match": { "title": "how to make millions" }},
        "must_not": { "match": { "tag":   "spam" }},
        "should": [
            { "match": { "tag": "starred" }},
            { "range": { "date": { "gte": "2014-01-01" }}}
        ]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 054_Query_DSL/70_Bool_query.json

If there are no `must` clauses, then at least one `should` clause has to
match, but if there is at least one `must` clause, then no `should`
clauses are required to match.
