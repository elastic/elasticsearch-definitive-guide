=== Pagination

Our <<empty-search,empty search above>> told us that there are 14 documents in the
cluster which match our (empty) query.  But there were only 10 documents in
the `hits` array.  How can we see the other documents?

In the same way as SQL uses the `LIMIT` keyword to return a single ``page'' of
results, Elasticsearch accepts the `from` and `size` parameters:

[horizontal]
`size`:: How many results should be returned, defaults to `10`
`from`:: How many initial results should be skipped, defaults to `0`

If you wanted to show 5 results per page, then pages 1 to 3
could be requested as:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search?size=5
GET /_search?size=5&from=5
GET /_search?size=5&from=10
--------------------------------------------------

Beware of paging too deep or requesting too many results at once. Results are
sorted before being returned. But remember that a search request usually spans
multiple shards. Each shard generates its own sorted results, which then need
to be sorted centrally to ensure that the overall order is correct.

.Deep paging in distributed systems
****

To understand why deep paging is problematic, let's imagine that we are
searching within a single index with 5 primary shards.  When we request the
first page of results (results 1 to 10), each shard produces its own top 10
results and returns them to the _requesting node_, which then sorts all 50
results in order to select the overall top 10.

Now imagine that we ask for page 1,000 -- results 10,001 to 10,010. Everything
works in the same way except that each shard has to produce its top 10,010
results. The requesting node then sorts through all 50,050 results and
discards 50,040 of them!

You can see that, in a distributed system, the cost of sorting results
grows exponentially the deeper we page.  There is a very good reason
why web search engines don't return more than 1,000 results for any query.

TIP: In <<reindex>> we will explain how you *can* retrieve large numbers of
documents efficiently.
