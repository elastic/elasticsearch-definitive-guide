== Scripting – when you need more

Sometimes, the default functionality just isn't enough – instead, we need to
apply some custom logic that can only be expressed programmatically. For this
reason, the ability to incorporate custom scripts into the search process is
integral to Elasticsearch.

In this chapter we explore the scripting functionality, discuss where we can
use scripting and provide commonly used example scripts.
