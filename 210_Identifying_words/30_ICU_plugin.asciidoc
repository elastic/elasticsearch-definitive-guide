=== Installing the ICU plugin

The https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-analysis-icu[ICU analysis
plugin]  for Elasticsearch uses the _International Components for Unicode_
(ICU) libraries  (see http://site.icu-project.org[site.project.org]) to
provide a rich set of tools for dealing with Unicode. These include the
`icu_tokenizer` which is particularly useful for Asian languages, and a number
of token filters which are essential for correct matching in sorting in all
languages other than English.

[NOTE]
==================================================

The ICU plugin is an essential tool for dealing with languages other than
English, and it is highly recommended that you install and use it.
Unfortunately, because it is based on the external ICU libraries, different
versions of the ICU plugin may not be compatible with previous versions.  When
upgrading, you may need to reindex your data.

==================================================

To install the plugin, first shutdown your Elasticsearch node, then run the
following command from the Elasticsearch home directory:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
./bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-analysis-icu/$VERSION <1>
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The current `$VERSION` can be found at
    https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-analysis-icu[github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-analysis-icu].

Once installed, restart Elasticsearch, and you should see a line similar to the
following in the startup logs:

    [INFO][plugins] [Mysterio] loaded [marvel, analysis-icu], sites [marvel]

If you are running a cluster with multiple nodes, you will need to install the
plugin on every node in the cluster.
