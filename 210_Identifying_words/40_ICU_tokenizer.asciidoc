[[icu-tokenizer]]
=== `icu_tokenizer`

The `icu_tokenizer` uses the same Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm as the
`standard` tokenizer, but adds better support for some Asian languages by
using a dictionary-based approach to identify words in Thai, Lao, Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean, and using custom rules to break Myanmar and Khmer text
into syllables.

For instance, compare the tokens produced by the `standard` and
`icu_tokenizers` respectively when tokenizing ``Hello. I am from Bangkok.'' in
Thai:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_analyze?tokenizer=standard
สวัสดี ผมมาจากกรุงเทพฯ
--------------------------------------------------

The `standard` tokenizer produces two tokens, one for each sentence: `สวัสดี`,
`ผมมาจากกรุงเทพฯ`.  That is only useful if you want to search for the whole
sentence ``I am from Bangkok.'', but not if you want to search for just
``Bangkok''.


[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_analyze?tokenizer=icu_tokenizer
สวัสดี ผมมาจากกรุงเทพฯ
--------------------------------------------------

The `icu_tokenizer`, on the other hand, is able to break up the text into the
individual words: `สวัสดี`, `ผม`, `มา`, `จาก`, `กรุงเทพฯ`, making them
easier to search.

In contrast, the `standard` tokenizer ``over-tokenizes'' Chinese and Japanese
text, often breaking up whole words into single characters. Because there
are no spaces between words, it can be difficult to tell if consecutive
characters are separate words or form a single word.  For instance:

* 向 means ``facing'', 日 means ``sun'' and 葵 means ``hollyhock''. When
  written together as 向日葵 it means ``sunflower''.

* 五 means ``five'' or ``fifth'', 月 means ``month'' and 雨 means ``rain''.
  The first two characters written together as 五月 means ``the month
  of May'' and, together with the third character, 五月雨 means
  ``continuous rain''. When combined with a fourth character 式,
  meaning ``style'', the word 五月雨式 becomes an adjective for anything
  consecutive or unrelenting.

Although each character may be a word in its own right, tokens are more
meaningful when they retain the bigger original concept instead of just the
component parts.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_analyze?tokenizer=standard
向日葵

GET /_analyze?tokenizer=icu_tokenizer
向日葵
--------------------------------------------------

The `standard` tokenizer in the above example would emit each character
as a separate token: `向`, `日`, `葵`, while the `icu_tokenizer` would
emit the single token `向日葵` (sunflower).

Another difference between the `standard` tokenizer and the `icu_tokenizer` is
that the latter will break a word containing characters written in different
scripts (e.g. `βeta`) into separate tokens -- `β`, `eta` -- while the
former will emit the word as a single token: `βeta`.
