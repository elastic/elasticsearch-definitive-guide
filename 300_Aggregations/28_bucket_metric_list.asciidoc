// I'd limit this list to the metrics and rely on the obvious. You don't need to explain what min/max/avg etc are.  Then say that we'll discusss these more interesting metrics in later chapters: cardinality, percentiles, significant terms. The buckets I'd mention under the relevant section, eg Histo & Range, etc

== Available Buckets and Metrics

Elasticsearch has various buckets and metrics.((("buckets", "available types of, reference list")))((("aggregations", "available buckets and metrics")))  The reference documentation
does a great job describing the parameters and how they affect
the component.  Instead of re-describing them here, we are simply going to
link to the reference docs and provide a brief description.  Skim the list
so you know what is available, and check the reference docs when you need
exact parameters.((("metrics", "available types of, reference list")))

=== Buckets

    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Global]: includes all documents in your index
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Filter]: only includes documents that match
    the filter
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Missing]: all documents which _do not_ have
    a particular field
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Terms]: generates a new bucket for each unique term
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Range]: creates arbitrary ranges which documents
    fall into
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Date Range]: similar to Range, but calendar
    aware
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[IPV4 Range]: similar to Range, but can handle "IP logic" like CIDR masks, etc
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Geo Distance]: similar to Range, but operates on
    geo points
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Histogram]: equal-width, dynamic ranges
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Date Histogram]: similar to Histogram, but
    calendar aware
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Nested]: a special bucket for working with
    nested documents (see <<nested-aggregation>>)
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Geohash Grid]: partitions documents according to
    what geohash grid they fall into (see <<geohash-grid-agg>>)
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[TopHits]: Return the top search results grouped by the value of a field (see <<top-hits>>)

=== Metrics

    - Individual statistics: See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Min], See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Max], See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Avg], See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Sum]
    - {See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Stats]: calculates min/mean/max/sum/count of documents in bucket
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Extended Stats]: Same as stats, except it also includes variance, std deviation, sum of squares
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Value Count]: calculates the number of values, which may
    be different from the number of documents (e.g. multi-valued fields)
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Cardinality]: calculates number of distinct/unique values (see <<cardinality>>)
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Percentiles]: calculates percentiles/quantiles for
    numeric values in a bucket (see <<percentiles>>)
    - See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzzy-query.html#fuzzy-query[Significant Terms]: finds "uncommonly common" terms
    (see <<significant-terms>>)
