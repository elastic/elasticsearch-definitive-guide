== Building Bar Charts

One of the exciting aspects of aggregations are how easily they are converted
into charts and graphs.((("bar charts", "building from aggregations")))((("aggregations", "building bar charts from")))  In this chapter, we are focusing
on various analytics that we can wring out of our example dataset.  We will also
demonstrate the types of charts aggregations can power.

The ++histogram++ bucket is particularly useful.((("buckets", "histogram")))((("histogram bucket")))((("histograms")))  Histograms are essentially
bar charts, and if you've ever built a report or analytics dashboard, you
undoubtedly had a few bar charts in it. The histogram works by specifying an interval.  If we were histogramming sale
prices, you might specify an interval of 20,000.  This would create a new bucket
every $20,000.  Documents are then sorted into buckets.

// Perhaps "demonstrate" that a car of 28,000 gets dropped into the "20,000" bucket,while a car of 15,000 gets dropped into the "0" bucket
// Delete "Just like the ...."

For our dashboard, we want a bar chart of car sale prices, but we
also want to know the top-selling make per price range.  This is easily accomplished
using a `terms` bucket ((("terms bucket", "nested in a histogram bucket")))((("buckets", "nested in other buckets", "terms bucket nested in histogram bucket")))nested inside the `histogram`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /cars/transactions/_search?search_type=count
{
   "aggs":{
      "price":{
         "histogram":{
            "field":"price",    <1>
            "interval":20000    <1>
         },
         "aggs":{
            "make":{
               "terms":{
                  "field":"make",   <2>
                  "size":1
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 300_Aggregations/30_histogram.json
<1> The `histogram` bucket requires two parameters: a numeric field, and an
interval that defines the bucket size.
// Mention use of "size" to get back just the top result?
<2> A `terms` bucket is nested inside each price range, which will show us the
top make per price range.

// Make the point that the upper limit is exclusive
As you can see, our query is built around the `price` aggregation, which contains
a `histogram` bucket.  This bucket requires a numeric field to calculate
buckets on, and an interval size.  The interval defines how "wide" each bucket
is.  An interval of 20000 means we will have the ranges `[0-20000, 20000-40000, ...]`.

Next, we define a nested bucket inside the histogram.  This is a `terms` bucket
over the `make` field.  There is also a new `size` parameter, which defines the number of terms we want to generate.  A `size` of `1` means we want only the top make
for each price range (the make that has the highest doc count).

And here is the response (truncated):

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
...
   "aggregations": {
      "price": {
         "buckets": [
            {
               "key": 0,
               "doc_count": 3,
               "make": {
                  "buckets": [
                     {
                        "key": "honda",
                        "doc_count": 1
                     }
                  ]
               }
            },
            {
               "key": 20000,
               "doc_count": 4,
               "make": {
                  "buckets": [
                     {
                        "key": "ford",
                        "doc_count": 2
                     }
                  ]
               }
            },
...
}
--------------------------------------------------

The response is fairly self-explanatory, but it should be noted that the
histogram keys correspond to the lower boundary of the interval.  The key `0`
means `0-20,000`, the key `20000` means `20,000-40,000`, and so forth.

Graphically, you could represent the preceding data in the histogram shown in <<barcharts-histo1>>:

[[barcharts-histo1]]
.Histogram of top makes per price range

Of course, you can build bar charts with any aggregation that emits categories
and statistics, not just the `histogram` bucket.  Let's build a bar chart of
popular makes, and their average price, and then calculate the standard error
to add error bars on our chart.  This will use the `terms` bucket
and an `extended_stats` ((("extended_stats metric")))metric:

[source,js]
----
GET /cars/transactions/_search?search_type=count
{
  "aggs": {
    "makes": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "make",
        "size": 10
      },
      "aggs": {
        "stats": {
          "extended_stats": {
            "field": "price"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

This will return a list of makes (sorted by popularity) and a variety of statistics
about each.  In particular, we are interested in `stats.avg`, `stats.count`,
and `stats.std_deviation`.  Using((("standard error, calculating"))) this information, we can calculate the standard error:

................................
std_err = std_deviation / count
................................

This will allow us to build a chart like <<barcharts-bar1>>:

[[barcharts-bar1]]
.Barchart of average price per make, with error bars
