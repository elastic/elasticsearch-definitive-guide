[[multi_match_query]]
==== `multi_match` query

The `multi_match` query works in exactly the same way as the
<<match_query,`match` query>>, but allows you to run the same query
on several fields at the same time.

    {
        "multi_match" : {
            "query"   : "quick brown fox",
            "fields"  : ["title", "content"]
        }
    }

===== Boosting individual fields

If, in the example above,  the `title` field should be considered more
relevant than the `content` field, then you can <<query_boost,`boost`>>
each field by appending `^` plus a number to the field name:

    {
        "multi_match" : {
            "query"   : "quick brown fox",
            "fields"  : ["title^2", "content"]
        }
    }

===== Wildcard field names

You can use wildcards (`*`) in the field name to match several fields at once.
For instance, the query below would search the fields `father.name`,
`wife.name` and `child.name`:

    {
        "multi_match" : {
            "query"   : "quick brown fox",
            "fields"  : [ "*.name" ]
        }
    }
