== Aggregations – real time analytics

Aggregations allow us to perform real-time analytics by grouping or
aggregating big data.

For instance, aggregations can be used to show totals-per-category, the most
popular  search terms, relevant tags to restrict searches, graphs of timelines or
the number of results within a geographic range.
