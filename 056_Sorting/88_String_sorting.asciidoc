=== String Sorting and Multifields

Analyzed string fields are also multivalue fields,((("strings", "sorting on string fields")))((("analyzed fields", "string fields")))((("sorting", "string sorting and multifields"))) but sorting on them seldom
gives you the results you want. If you analyze a string like `fine old art`,
it results in three terms. We probably want to sort alphabetically on the
first term, then the second term, and so forth, but Elasticsearch doesn't have this
information at its disposal at sort time.

You could use the `min` and `max` sort modes (it uses `min` by default), but
that will result in sorting on either `art` or `old`, neither of which was the
intent.

In order to sort on a string field, that field should contain one term only:
the whole `not_analyzed` string.((("not_analyzed string fields", "sorting on")))  But of course we still need the field to be
`analyzed` in order to be able to query it as full text.

The naive approach to indexing the same string in two ways would be to include
two separate fields in the document: one that is  `analyzed` for searching,
and one that is `not_analyzed` for sorting.

But  storing the same string twice in the `_source` field is waste of space.
What we really want to do is to pass in a _single field_ but to _index it in two different ways_. All of the _core_ field types (strings, numbers,
Booleans, dates) accept a `fields` parameter ((("mapping (types)", "transforming simple mapping to multifield mapping")))((("types", "core simple field types", "accepting fields parameter")))((("fields parameter")))((("multifield mapping")))that allows you to transform a
simple mapping like

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"tweet": {
    "type":     "string",
    "analyzer": "english"
}
--------------------------------------------------

into a _multifield_ mapping like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"tweet": { <1>
    "type":     "string",
    "analyzer": "english",
    "fields": {
        "raw": { <2>
            "type":  "string",
            "index": "not_analyzed"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 056_Sorting/88_Multifield.json

<1> The main `tweet` field is just the same as before: an `analyzed` full-text
    field.
<2> The new `tweet.raw` subfield is `not_analyzed`.

Now, or at least as soon as we have reindexed our data, we can use the `tweet`
field for search and the `tweet.raw` field for sorting:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "tweet": "elasticsearch"
        }
    },
    "sort": "tweet.raw"
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 056_Sorting/88_Multifield.json

WARNING: Sorting on a full-text `analyzed` field can use a lot of memory.  See
<<fielddata-intro>> for more information.
