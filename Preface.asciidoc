== Preface

****
This book is a work in progress – new chapters will be added as they are written. The content of this book describes the latest version of Elasticsearch. 

We welcome feedback – if you spot any errors or would like to suggest improvements, please https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-definitive-guide/issues[open an issue] on the GitHub repo. 
****

The quantity of data swimming through our systems is simply overwhelming.  Existing
technology has mostly focused on how to store and organize warehouses full of data.
That's all well and good... until you actually need to make decisions in
real-time based on that data.

Elasticsearch is a distributed scalable real-time search and analytics engine.
You might not know what this means, but you will by the end of the book.
Elasticsearch enables you to search, analyze and explore your data, often in ways that
you did not anticipate when you collected the data.

Whether you need full text search, real-time analytics of structured data, or
a combination of the two, this book introduces the fundamental
concepts required to start working with Elasticsearch. With
these foundations laid, the book will move on to more advanced search techniques,
allowing you to tailor your searches to fit your requirements.

Elasticsearch is not just about full text search. We explain structured
search, analytics, query percolation, geolocation and autocomplete or _did-
you-mean_ suggesters. Again, don't worry if you don't know what these terms mean.
 We will also discuss how best to organize your data to take
advantage of the horizontal scalability of Elasticsearch, and how to configure
and monitor your Elasticsearch servers  when moving to production.

=== Who should read this book

This book is for anybody who wants to put their data to work.  It doesn't
matter whether you are starting a new project and have the flexibility to
design the system from the ground up, or whether you need to give new life to
a legacy system.  Elasticsearch will help you solve existing problems and
open the way to using new techniques that you haven't yet considered.

This book is suitable for novices and experienced users alike. We expect you
to have some programming background and, although not required, it would help
to have used SQL and a relational database. We explain concepts from first
principles, helping novices gain sure footing in the complex world of
search.

The reader with a search background will also benefit from this book.
Elasticsearch is a new technology based on some familiar concepts.  The more
experienced user will gain an understanding of how those concepts have been
implemented and how they interact in Elasticsearch. Even in the
early chapters, there are nuggets of information that will be useful to the
more advanced user.

Finally, maybe you are in DevOps. While the other departments are stuffing
data into Elasticsearch as fast as they can, you're the one charged with
preventing their servers from bursting into flames. Elasticsearch scales
effortlessly, as long as your users play by the rules. You need to know
how to setup a stable Elasticsearch environment before going into production, then be able to
recognize the warning signs at 3am in the morning in order to prevent
catastrophe. The earlier chapters may be of less interest to you but the last
part of the book is essential reading -- all you need to know to avoid
disaster.


=== Why we wrote this book

We wrote this book because Elasticsearch needs a narrative.  The existing
reference documentation is excellent... as long as you know what you are
looking for. It assumes that you are intimately familiar with information
retrieval concepts, distributed systems, the query DSL and a host of other
topics.

This book makes no such assumptions.  It has been written so that a complete
beginner -- to both search and distributed systems -- can pick it up and start
building a prototype within a few chapters.

We have taken a problem based approach: this is the problem, how do I solve
it, and what are the trade-offs compared to the alternatives? We start with the
basics, building each chapter on the preceding ones, providing practical
examples and explaining the theory where necessary.

The existing reference documentation explains *how* to use features.  We want
this book to explain *why* and *when* to use various features.

=== How to read this book

Elasticsearch tries very hard to make the complex simple, and to a large
degree it succeeds. That said, search and distributed systems *are*
complex and sooner or later you have to get to grips with some of the
complexity in order to take full advantage of Elasticsearch.

Complexity, however, is not the same as magic.  We tend to view complex
systems as magical black boxes that respond to incantations, but they are
usually based on simple concepts. Understanding these concepts helps
to disspell the magic -- instead of hoping that the black box will do what you
want, understanding the basic concepts gives you clarity.

This is a definitive guide: not only do we help you get started with
Elasticsearch, we tackle the deeper more interesting topics too. These include
chapters such as <<distributed-cluster>>, <<distributed-docs>> and
<<distributed-search>>, which are not essential reading but do give you a solid
understanding how Elasticsearch does what it does.

The first part of the book should be read in order as each chapter builds on
the previous chapter (although you can skim over the chapters mentioned
above).  Later chapters like <<partial-matching>> and <<proximity-matching>>
are more standalone and can be referred to as needed.

=== Navigating this book

This book is divided into five parts:

*  Chapters 1 through 10 provide an introduction to Elasticsearch. They
   explain how to get your data in and out of Elasticsearch, how Elasticsearch
   interprets the data in your documents, how basic search works and how to
   manage indices. By the end of this part you will be ready to
   add Elasticsearch to your application. Chapters 2, 4 and 9 are
   supplemental chapters which provide more insight into distributed
   search, but are not required reading.

*  Chapters 11 through 21 offer a deep dive into search -- how to index and
   query your data to take advantage of more advanced concepts
   like word proximity, partial matching, fuzzy matching and language
   awareness. You will understand how relevance works and how to control it
   to ensure that the best results come first.

*  Chapters 22 through 25 tackle subjects such as aggregations, analytics,
   geolocation, query percolation and scripting.

*  Chapters 26 through 28 teach how to understand the flow of data through
   your system and how to organize your data to work well with the infrastructure
   provided by Elasticsearch.

*  Finally, chapters 29 through 31 discuss moving to production: important
   configurations, what to monitor, and how to diagnose and prevent problems.


=== Online Resources

Because this book focuses on problem solving in Elasticsearch rather than Elasticsearch syntax, we sometimes reference the existing documentation for a complete
list of parameters.  The reference documentation can be found here:
