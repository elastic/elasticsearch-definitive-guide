== Boost – tuning search relevance

The question “which documents are most relevant” seldom depends purely on 
whether the search terms appear in a document. Instead, a `title` field may be 
more relevant than the `body` field, recently published results may be more 
relevant than results from 2 years ago, or results that are geographically 
closer to the user may be of more interest than those from Timbuktu. 

This chapter explains how to tune search relevance.
