=== Query Phase

During the initial _query phase_,  the query is broadcast to a shard copy (a
primary or replica shard) of every shard in the index. Each shard executes
the search locally and builds a _priority queue_ of matching documents.

.Priority queue
****

A priority queue is just a sorted list which holds the _Top-N_ matching
documents. The size of the priority queue depends on the pagination
parameters: `from` and `size`.  For example, the following search request
would require a priority queue big enough to hold 100 documents:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "from": 90,
    "size": 10
}
--------------------------------------------------

The query phase process is depicted in <<img-distrib-search>>.

1. The client sends a `search` request to `Node 3` which creates an empty
   priority queue of size `from + size`.

2. `Node 3` forwards the search request to a primary or replica copy of every
   shard in the index. Each shard executes the query locally and adds the
   results into a local sorted priority queue of size `from + size`.

3. Each shard returns the doc IDs and sort values of all of the docs in its
   priority queue to the coordinating node, `Node 3`, which merges these
   values into its own priority queue to produce a globally sorted list of
   results.

When a search request is sent to a node, that node becomes the coordinating
node. It is the job of this node to broadcast the search request to all
involved shards, and to gather their responses into a globally sorted result
set which it can return to the client.

The first step is to broadcast the request to a shard copy of every node in
the index. Just like <<distrib-read,document `GET` requests>>, search requests
can be handled by a primary shard or by any of its replicas. This is how more
replicas (when combined with more hardware) can increase search throughput.
A coordinating node will round robin through all shard copies on subsequent
requests in order to spread the load.

Each shard executes the query locally and builds a sorted priority queue of
length `from + size`, in other words enough results to satisfy the global
search request all by itself. It returns a lightweight list of results to the
coordinating node, which contains just the doc IDs and any values required for
sorting, such as the `_score`.

The coordinating node merges these shard-level results into its own sorted
priority queue which represents the globally sorted result set. Here the query
phase ends.

.Multi-index search
****

An index can consist of one or more primary shards, so a search request
against a single index needs to be able to combine the results from multiple
shards. A search against *multiple* or *all* indices works in exactly the same
way --  there are just more shards involved.
