[[geohash-mapping]]
=== Mapping geohashes

The first step is to decide just how much precision you need.((("geohashes", "mapping")))((("mapping (types)", "geohashes")))  While you could
index all geo-points with the default full 12 levels of precision, do you
really need to be accurate to within a few centimeters? You can save yourself
a lot of space in the index by reducing your precision requirements to
something more realistic, such as `1km`.((("geohash_precision parameter")))((("geohash_prefix parameter")))

<1> Setting `geohash_prefix` to `true` tells Elasticsearch to index
    all geohash prefixes, up to the specified precision.
<2> The precision can be specified as an absolute number, representing the
    length of the geohash, or as a distance. A precision of `1km` corresponds
    to a geohash of length `7`.

With this mapping in place, geohash prefixes of lengths 1 to 7 will be indexed,
providing geohashes accuracy to about 150 meters.
