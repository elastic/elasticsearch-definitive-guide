=== Cluster Health

An Elasticsearch cluster may consist of a single node with a single index.  Or it((("cluster health")))((("clusters", "administration", "Cluster Health API")))
may have a hundred data nodes, three dedicated masters, a few dozen clients nodes
...all operating on a thousand indices (and tens of thousands of shards).

No matter the scale of the cluster, you'll want a quick way to assess the status
of your cluster.  The _Cluster Health_ API fills that role.  You can think of it
as a ten-thousand foot view of your cluster.  It can reassure you that everything
is alright, or alert you to a problem somewhere in your cluster.

Let's execute a Health API and see what the response looks like:

[source,bash]
----
GET _cluster/health
----

Like other APIs in Elasticsearch, Cluster Health will return a JSON response.
This makes it convenient to parse for automation and alerting.  The response
contains some critical information about your cluster:

[source,js]
----
{
   "cluster_name": "elasticsearch_zach",
   "status": "green",
   "timed_out": false,
   "number_of_nodes": 1,
   "number_of_data_nodes": 1,
   "active_primary_shards": 10,
   "active_shards": 10,
   "relocating_shards": 0,
   "initializing_shards": 0,
   "unassigned_shards": 0
}
----

The most important piece of information in the response is the `"status"` field.
The status may be one of three values:

- *Green:* all primary and replica shards are allocated. Your cluster is 100%
operational
- *Yellow:* all primary shards are allocated, but at least one replica is missing.
No data is missing so search results will still be complete. However,  your 
high-availability is compromised to some degree.  If _more_ shards disappear, you
might lose data.  Think of Yellow as a warning which should prompt investigation.
- *Red:* at least one primary shard (and all of its replicas) are missing. This means
that you are missing data: searches will return partial results and indexing
into that shard will return an exception.

The Green/Yellow/Red status is a great way to glance at your cluster and understand
what's going on.  The rest of the metrics give you a general summary of your cluster:

- `number_of_nodes` and `number_of_data_nodes` are fairly self-descriptive.
- `active_primary_shards` are the number of primary shards in your cluster. This
is an aggregate total across all indices.
- `active_shards` is an aggregate total of _all_ shards across all indices, which
includes replica shards
- `relocating_shards` shows the number of shards that are currently moving from
one node to another node.  This number is often zero, but can increase when
Elasticsearch decides a cluster is not properly balanced, a new node is added,
a node is taken down, etc.
- `initializing_shards` is a count of shards that are being freshly created. For 
example, when you first create an index, the shards will all briefly reside in
"initializing" state.  This is typically a transient event and shards shouldn't
linger in "initializing" too long.  You may also see initializing shards when a 
node is first restarted...as shards are loaded from disk they start as "initializing"
- `unassigned_shards` are shards that exist in the cluster state, but cannot be
found in the cluster itself.  A common source of unassigned shards are unassigned
replicas.  For example, an index with 5 shards and 1 replica will have 5 unassigned
replicas in a single-node cluster.  Unassigned shards will also be present if your
cluster is red (since primaries are missing)

==== Drilling deeper: finding problematic indices

Imagine something goes wrong one day, and you notice that your cluster health
looks like this:

[source,js]
----
{
   "cluster_name": "elasticsearch_zach",
   "status": "red",
   "timed_out": false,
   "number_of_nodes": 8,
   "number_of_data_nodes": 8,
   "active_primary_shards": 90,
   "active_shards": 180,
   "relocating_shards": 0,
   "initializing_shards": 0,
   "unassigned_shards": 20
}
----

Ok, so what can we deduce from this health status?  Well, our cluster is Red,
which means we are missing data (primary + replicas).  We know our cluster has
ten nodes, but only see 8 data nodes listed in the health.  Two of our nodes
have gone missing.  We see that there are 20 unassigned shards.  

That's about all the information we can glean.  The nature of those missing
shards are still a mystery.  Are we missing 20 indices with one primary shard each?
One index with 20 primary shards? Ten indices with one primary + one replica?
Which index? 

To answer these questions, we need to ask the Cluster Health for a little more
information by using the `level` parameter.

[source,bash]
----
GET _cluster/health?level=indices
----

This parameter will make the Cluster Health API to add a list of indices in our
cluster and details about each of those indices (status, number of shards,
unassigned shards, etc):

[source,js]
----
{
   "cluster_name": "elasticsearch_zach",
   "status": "red",
   "timed_out": false,
   "number_of_nodes": 8,
   "number_of_data_nodes": 8,
   "active_primary_shards": 90,
   "active_shards": 180,
   "relocating_shards": 0,
   "initializing_shards": 0,
   "unassigned_shards": 20
   "indices": {
      "v1": {
         "status": "green",
         "number_of_shards": 10,
         "number_of_replicas": 1,
         "active_primary_shards": 10,
         "active_shards": 20,
         "relocating_shards": 0,
         "initializing_shards": 0,
         "unassigned_shards": 0
      },
      "v2": {
         "status": "red", <1>
         "number_of_shards": 10,
         "number_of_replicas": 1,
         "active_primary_shards": 0,
         "active_shards": 0,
         "relocating_shards": 0,
         "initializing_shards": 0,
         "unassigned_shards": 20 <2>
      },
      "v3": {
         "status": "green",
         "number_of_shards": 10,
         "number_of_replicas": 1,
         "active_primary_shards": 10,
         "active_shards": 20,
         "relocating_shards": 0,
         "initializing_shards": 0,
         "unassigned_shards": 0
      },
      ....
   }
}
----
<1> We can now see that the `v2` index is the index which has made the cluster Red
<2> And it becomes clear that all 20 missing shards are from this index

Once we ask for the indices output, it becomes immediately clear which index is
having problems: the `v2` index.  We also see that the index has 10 primary shards
and one replica, and that all 20 shards are missing.  Presumably these 20 shards
were on the two nodes that are missing from our cluster.

The `level` parameter accepts one more option:

[source,bash]
----
GET _cluster/health?level=shards
----

The `shards` option will provide a very verbose output, which lists the status 
and location of every shard inside every index.  This output is sometimes useful,
but due to the verbosity can difficult to work with.  Once you know the index
that is having problems, other APIs that we discuss in this chapter will tend 
to be more helpful.

==== Blocking for status changes

The Cluster Health API has another neat trick which is very useful when building
unit and integration tests, or automated scripts that work with Elasticsearch.
You can specify a `wait_for_status` parameter, which will make the call block
until the status is satisfied.  For example:

[source,bash]
----
GET _cluster/health?wait_for_status=green
----

This call will block (e.g. not return control to your program) until the cluster
health has turned green, meaning all primary + replica shards have been allocated.
This is very important for automated scripts and tests.

If you create an index, Elasticsearch must broadcast the change in cluster state
to all nodes.  Those nodes must initialize those new shards, then respond to the
master that the shards are Started.  This process is very fast, but due to network
latency may take 10-20ms.

If you have an automated script that A) creates an index and then B) immediately
attempts to index a document, this operation may fail since the index has not
been fully initialized yet.  The time between A) and B) will likely be <1ms...
not nearly enough time to account for network latency.

Rather than sleeping, just have your script/test call the cluster health with
a `wait_for_status` parameter.  As soon as the index is fully created, the cluster
health will change to Green, the call returns control to your script, and you may
begin indexing.

Valid options are `green`, `yellow` and `red`.  The call will return when the 
requested status (or one "higher") is reached.  E.g. if you request `yellow`,
a status change to `yellow` or `green` will unblock the call.
