=== Monitoring individual nodes

Cluster Health is at one end of the spectrum -- a very high-level overview of
everything in your cluster.  The _Node Stats_ API is at the other end.  It provides
an bewildering array of statistics about each node in your cluster.

Node Stats provides so many stats that, until you are accustomed to the output,
you may be unsure which metrics are most important to keep an eye on.  We'll
highlight the most important metrics to monitor (but note: we'd encourage you to
log all the metrics provided -- or use Marvel -- because you'll never know when
you need one stat or another)

The Node Stats API can be executed with the following:

[source,bash]
----
GET _nodes/stats
----

Starting at the top of the output, we see the cluster name and our first node:

[source,js]
----
{
   "cluster_name": "elasticsearch_zach",
   "nodes": {
      "UNr6ZMf5Qk-YCPA_L18BOQ": {
         "timestamp": 1408474151742,
         "name": "Zach",
         "transport_address": "inet[zacharys-air/192.168.1.131:9300]",
         "host": "zacharys-air",
         "ip": [
            "inet[zacharys-air/192.168.1.131:9300]",
            "NONE"
         ],
...
----

The nodes are listed in a hash, with the key being the UUID of the node.  Some
information about the node's network properties are displayed (transport address,
host, etc).  These values are useful for debugging discovery problems, where
nodes won't join the cluster.  Often you'll see that the port being used is wrong,
or the node is binding to the wrong IP address/interface.

==== Indices section

The indices section lists aggregate statistics for all the indices that reside
on this particular node.

[source,js]
----
    "indices": {
        "docs": {
           "count": 6163666,
           "deleted": 0
        },
        "store": {
           "size_in_bytes": 2301398179,
           "throttle_time_in_millis": 122850
        },
----

- `docs` shows how many documents reside on
this node, as well as the number of deleted docs which haven't been purged
from segments yet.

- The `store` portion indicates how much physical storage is consumed by the node.
This metric includes both primary and replica shards.  If the throttle time is
large, it may be an indicator that your disk throttling is set too low
(discussed later in <<segments-and-merging>>).

[source,js]
----
        "indexing": {
           "index_total": 803441,
           "index_time_in_millis": 367654,
           "index_current": 99,
           "delete_total": 0,
           "delete_time_in_millis": 0,
           "delete_current": 0
        },
        "get": {
           "total": 6,
           "time_in_millis": 2,
           "exists_total": 5,
           "exists_time_in_millis": 2,
           "missing_total": 1,
           "missing_time_in_millis": 0,
           "current": 0
        },
        "search": {
           "open_contexts": 0,
           "query_total": 123,
           "query_time_in_millis": 531,
           "query_current": 0,
           "fetch_total": 3,
           "fetch_time_in_millis": 55,
           "fetch_current": 0
        },
        "merges": {
           "current": 0,
           "current_docs": 0,
           "current_size_in_bytes": 0,
           "total": 1128,
           "total_time_in_millis": 21338523,
           "total_docs": 7241313,
           "total_size_in_bytes": 5724869463
        },
----

- `indexing` shows how many docs have been indexed.  This value is a monotonically
increasing counter, it doesn't decrease when docs are deleted.  Also note that it
is incremented any time an _index_ operation happens internally, which includes
things like updates.
+
Also listed are times for indexing, how many docs are currently being indexed,
and similar statistics for deletes.

- `get` shows statistics about get-by-ID statistics.  This includes GETs and
HEAD requests for a single document

- `search` describes the number of active searches (`open_contexts`), number of
queries total and how much time has been spent on queries since the node was
started.  The ratio between `query_time_in_millis / query_total` can be used as a
rough indicator for how efficient your queries are.  The larger the ratio,
the more time each query is taking and you should consider tuning or optimization.
+
The fetch statistics details the second half of the query process (the "fetch" in
query-then-fetch).  If more time is spent in fetch than query, this can be an
indicator of slow disks or very large documents which are being fetched.  Or
potentially search requests with too large of paginations (`size: 10000`, etc).

- `merges` contains information about Lucene segment merges.  It will tell you
how many merges are currently active, how many docs are involved, the cumulative
size of segments being merged and how much time has been spent on merges in total.
+
Merge statistics can be important if your cluster is write-heavy.  Merging consumes
a large amount of disk I/O and CPU resources.  If your index is write-heavy and
you see large merge numbers, be sure to read <<indexing-performance>>.
+
Note: updates and deletes will contribute to large merge numbers too, since they
cause segment "fragmentation" which needs to be merged out eventually.

[source,js]
----
        "filter_cache": {
           "memory_size_in_bytes": 48,
           "evictions": 0
        },
        "id_cache": {
           "memory_size_in_bytes": 0
        },
        "fielddata": {
           "memory_size_in_bytes": 0,
           "evictions": 0
        },
        "segments": {
           "count": 319,
           "memory_in_bytes": 65812120
        },
        ...
----

- `filter_cache` describes how much memory is used by the cached filter bitsets,
and how many times a filter has been evicted.  A large number of evictions
_could_ be indicative that you need to increase the filter cache size, or that
your filters are not caching well (e.g. churn heavily due to high cardinality,
such as caching "now" date expressions).
+
However, evictions are a difficult metric to evaluate.  Filters are cached on a
per-segment basis, and evicting a filter from a small segment is much less
expensive than a filter on a large segment.  It's possible that you have a large
number of evictions, but they all occur on small segments, which means they have
little impact on query performance.
+
Use the eviction metric as a rough guideline.  If you see a large number, investigate
your filters to make sure they are caching well.  Filters that constantly evict,
even on small segments, will be much less effective than properly cached filters.

- `id_cache` shows the memory usage by Parent/Child mappings.  When you use
parent/children, the `id_cache` maintains an in-memory-join table which maintains
the relationship.  This statistic will show you how much memory is being used.
There is little you can do to affect this memory usage, since it is a fairly linear
relationship with the number of parent/child docs.  It is heap-resident, however,
so a good idea to keep an eye on it.

- `field_data` displays the memory used by field data, which is used for aggregations,
sorting, etc.  There is also an eviction count.  Unlike `filter_cache`, the eviction
count here is very useful:  it should be zero, or very close.  Since field data
is not a cache, any eviction is very costly and should be avoided.  If you see
evictions here, you need to re-evaluate your memory situation, field data limits,
queries or all three.

- `segments` will tell you how many Lucene segments this node currently serves.
This can be an important number.  Most indices should have around 50-150 segments,
even if they are terrabytes in size with billions of documents.  Large numbers
of segments can indicate a problem with merging (e.g. merging is not keeping up
with segment creation).  Note that this statistic is the aggregate total of all
indices on the node, so keep that in mind.
+
The `memory` statistic gives you an idea how much memory is being used by the
Lucene segments themselves.  This includes low-level data structures such as
posting lists, dictionaries and bloom filters.  A very large number of segments
will increase the amount of overhead lost to these data structures, and the memory
usage can be a handy metric to gauge that overhead.

==== OS and Process Sections

The OS and Process sections are fairly self-explanatory and won't be covered
in great detail.  They list basic resource statistics such as CPU and load.  The
OS section describes it for the entire OS, while the Process section shows just
what the Elasticsearch JVM process is using.

These are obviously useful metrics, but are often being measured elsewhere in your
monitoring stack. Some stats include:

- CPU
- Load
- Memory usage
- Swap usage
- Open file descriptors

==== JVM Section

The JVM section contains some critical information about the JVM process which
is running Elasticsearch.  Most importantly, it contains garbage collection details,
which have a large impact on the stability of your Elasticsearch cluster.

[[garbage_collector_primer]]
.Garbage Collection Primer
**********************************
Before we describe the stats, it is useful to give a crash course in garbage
collection and it's impact on Elasticsearch.  If you are familar with garbage
collection in the JVM, feel free to skip down.

Java is a _garbage collected_ language, which means that the programmer does
not manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.  The programmer simply
writes code, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manages the process of allocating
memory as needed, and then later cleaning up that memory when no longer needed.

When memory is allocated to a JVM process, it is allocated in a big chunk called
the _heap_.  The JVM then breaks the heap into two different groups, referred to as
"generations":

- Young (or Eden): the space where newly instantiated objects are allocated. The
young generation space is often quite small, usually 100mb-500mb.  The young-gen
also contains two "survivor" spaces
- Old: the space where older objects are stored.  These objects to be long-lived
and persist for a long time.  The old-gen is often much larger than then young-gen,
and Elasticsearch nodes can see old-gens as large as 30gb.

When an object is instantiated, it is placed into young-gen.  When the young
generation space is full, a young-gen GC is started.  Objects that are still
"alive" are moved into one of the survivor spaces, and "dead" objects are removed.
If an object has survived several young-gen GCs, it will be "tenured" into the
old generation.

A similar process happens in the old generation:  when the space becomes full, a
garbage collection is started and "dead" objects are removed.

Nothing comes for free, however.  Both the young and old generation garbage collectors
have phases which "stop the world".  During this time, the JVM literally halts
execution of the program so that it can trace the object graph and collect "dead"
objects.

During this "stop the world" phase, nothing happens.  Requests are not serviced,
pings are not responded to, shards are not relocated.  The world quite literally
stops.

This isn't a big deal for the young generation; its small size means GCs execute
quickly.  But the old-gen is quite a bit larger, and a slow GC here could mean
1s or even 15s of pausing...which is unacceptable for server software.

The garbage collectors in the JVM are _very_ sophisticated algorithms and do
a great job minimizing pauses.  And Elasticsearch tries very hard to be "garbage
collection friendly", by intelligently reusing objects internally, reusing network
buffers, offering features like <<doc-values>>, etc.  But ultimately,
GC frequency and duration is a metric that needs to be watched by you since it
is the number one culprit for cluster instability.

A cluster which is frequently experiencing long GC will be a cluster that is under
heavy load with not enough memory.  These long GCs will make nodes drop off the
cluster for brief periods.  This instability causes shards to relocate frequently
as ES tries to keep the cluster balanced and enough replicas available.  This in
turn increases network traffic and Disk I/O, all while your cluster is attempting
to service the normal indexing and query load.

In short, long GCs are bad and they need to be minimized as much as possible.
**********************************

Because garbage collection is so critical to ES, you should become intimately
familiar with this section of the Node Stats API:

[source,js]
----
        "jvm": {
            "timestamp": 1408556438203,
            "uptime_in_millis": 14457,
            "mem": {
               "heap_used_in_bytes": 457252160,
               "heap_used_percent": 44,
               "heap_committed_in_bytes": 1038876672,
               "heap_max_in_bytes": 1038876672,
               "non_heap_used_in_bytes": 38680680,
               "non_heap_committed_in_bytes": 38993920,

----

- The `jvm` section first lists some general stats about heap memory usage.  You
can see how much of the heap is being used, how much is committed (actually allocated
to the process), and the max size the heap is allowed to grow to.  Ideally,
`heap_committed_in_bytes` should be identical to `heap_max_in_bytes`.  If the
committed size is smaller, the JVM will have to resize the heap eventually...
and this is a very expensive process.  If your numbers are not identical, see
<<heap-sizing>> for how to configure it correctly.
+
The `heap_used_percent` metric is a useful number to keep an eye on.  Elasticsearch
is configured to initiate GCs when the heap reaches 75% full.  If your node is
consistently >= 75%, that indicates that your node is experiencing "memory pressure".
This is a warning sign that slow GCs may be in your near future.
+
If the heap usage is consistently >=85%, you are in trouble.  Heaps over 90-95%
are in risk of horrible performance with long 10-30s GCs at best, Out-of-memory
(OOM) exceptions at worst.

      }
   }
},
----

- The `young`, `survivor` and `old` sections will give you a breakdown of memory
usage of each generation in the GC.  These stats are handy to keep an eye on
relative sizes, but are often not overly important when debugging problems.

[source,js]
----
"gc": {
   "collectors": {
      "young": {
         "collection_count": 13,
         "collection_time_in_millis": 923
      },
      "old": {
         "collection_count": 0,
         "collection_time_in_millis": 0
      }
   }
}
----

- `gc` section shows the garbage collection counts and cumulative time for both
young and old generations.  You can safely ignore the young generation counts
for the most part:  this number will usually be very large.  That is perfectly
normal.
+
In contrast, the old generation collection count should remain very small, and
have a small `collection_time_in_millis`.  These are cumulative counts, so it is
hard to give an exact number when you should start worrying (e.g. a node with a
1-year uptime will have a large count even if it is healthy) -- this is one of the
reasons why tools such as Marvel are so helpful.  GC counts _over time_ are the
important consideration.
+
Time spent GC'ing is also important.  For example, a certain amount of garbage
is generated while indexing documents.  This is normal, and causes a GC every
now-and-then.  These GCs are almost always fast and have little effect on the
node -- young generation takes a millisecond or two, and old generation takes
a few hundred milliseconds.  This is much different from 10 second GCs.
+
Our best advice is to collect collection counts and duration periodically (or use Marvel)
and keep an eye out for frequent GCs.  You can also enable slow-GC logging,
discussed in <<logging>>.

==== Threadpool Section

Elasticsearch maintains a number of threadpools internally.  These threadpools
cooperate to get work done, passing work between each other as necessary. In
general, you don't need to configure or tune the threadpools, but it is sometimes
useful to see their stats so you can gain insight into how your cluster is behaving.

There are about a dozen threadpools, but they all share the same format:

[source,js]
----
  "index": {
     "threads": 1,
     "queue": 0,
     "active": 0,
     "rejected": 0,
     "largest": 1,
     "completed": 1
  }
----

Each threadpool lists the number of threads that are configured (`threads`),
how many of those threads are actively processing some work (`active`) and how
many work units are sitting in a queue (`queue`).

If the queue fills up to its limit, new workunits will begin to be rejected and
you will see that reflected in the `rejected` statistic.  This is often a sign
that your cluster is starting to bottleneck on some resources, since a full
queue means your node/cluster is processing at maximum speed but unable to keep
up with the influx of work.

.Bulk Rejections
****
If you are going to encounter queue rejections, it will most likely be caused
by Bulk indexing requests.  It is easy to send many Bulk requests to Elasticsearch
using concurrent import processes.  More is better, right?

In reality, each cluster has a certain limit at which it can not keep up with
ingestion.  Once this threshold is crossed, the queue will quickly fill up and
new bulks will be rejected.

This is a _good thing_.  Queue rejections are a useful form of back-pressure.  They
let you know that your cluster is at maximum capacity, which is much better than
sticking data into an in-memory queue.  Increasing the queue size doesn't increase
performance, it just hides the problem.  If your cluster can only process 10,000
doc/s, it doesn't matter if the queue is 100 or 10,000,000...your cluster can
still only process 10,000 docs/s.

The queue simply hides the performance problem and carries real risk of data-loss.
Anything sitting in a queue is by definition not processed yet.  If the node
goes down, all those requests are lost forever.  Furthermore, the queue eats
up a lot of memory, which is not ideal.

It is much better to handle queuing in your application by gracefully handling
the back-pressure from a full queue.  When you receive bulk rejections you should:

1. Pause the import thread for 3-5 seconds
2. Extract the rejected actions from the bulk response, since it is probable that
many of the actions were successful. The bulk response will tell you which succeeded,
and which were rejected.
3. Send a new bulk request with just the rejected actions
4. Repeat at step 1. if rejections were encountered again

Using this procedure, your code naturally adapts to the load of your cluster and
naturally backs off.

Rejections are not errors: they just mean you should try again later.
****

There are a dozen different threadpools.  Most you can safely ignore, but a few
are good to keep an eye on:

- `indexing`: threadpool for normal indexing requests
- `bulk`: bulk requests, which are distinct from the non-bulk indexing requests
- `get`: GET-by-ID operations
- `search`: all search and query requests
- `merging`: threadpool dedicated to managing Lucene merges

==== FS and Network sections

Continuing down the Node Stats API, you'll see a bunch of statistics about your
filesystem:  free space, data directory paths, disk IO stats, etc.  If you are
not monitoring free disk space, you can get those stats here.  The Disk IO stats
are also handy, but often more specialized command-line tools (`iostat`, etc)
are more useful.

Obviously, Elasticsearch has a difficult time functioning if you run out of disk
space...so make sure you don't :)

There are also two sections on network statistics:

[source,js]
----
        "transport": {
            "server_open": 13,
            "rx_count": 11696,
            "rx_size_in_bytes": 1525774,
            "tx_count": 10282,
            "tx_size_in_bytes": 1440101928
         },
         "http": {
            "current_open": 4,
            "total_opened": 23
         },
----

- `transport` shows some very basic stats about the "transport address".  This
relates to inter-node communication (often on port 9300) and any TransportClient
or NodeClient connections.  Don't worry yourself if you see many connections here,
Elasticsearch maintains a large number of connections between nodes

- `http` represents stats about the HTTP port (often 9200).  If you see a very
large `total_opened` number that is constantly increasing, that is a sure-sign
that one of your HTTP clients is not using keep-alive connections.  Persistent,
keep-alive connections are important for performance, since building up and tearing
down sockets is expensive (and wastes file descriptors).  Make sure your clients
are configured appropriately.

==== Circuit Breaker

Finally, we come to the last section: stats about the field data circuit breaker
(introduced in <<circuit-breaker>>):

[source,js]
----
         "fielddata_breaker": {
            "maximum_size_in_bytes": 623326003,
            "maximum_size": "594.4mb",
            "estimated_size_in_bytes": 0,
            "estimated_size": "0b",
            "overhead": 1.03,
            "tripped": 0
         }
----

Here, you can determine what the maximum circuit breaker size is (e.g. at what
size the circuit breaker will trip if a query attempts to use more memory).  It
will also let you know how many times the circuit breaker has been tripped, and
the currently configured "overhead".  The overhead is used to pad estimates
since some queries are more difficult to estimate than others.

The main thing to watch is the `tripped` metric.  If this number is large, or
consistently increasing, it's a sign that your queries may need to be optimized
or that you may need to obtain more memory (either per box, or by adding more
nodes).
