Whatever program we write, the intention is the same: to organize data in
a way that serves our purposes.  But data doesn't consist just of random bits
and bytes.  We relate data elements to each other in order to represent
entities or ``things'' that exist in the real world.  A name and an
email address have more meaning if we know that they are related to the same
person.

In the real world, though, not all entities of the same type look
the same.  One person might have a home telephone number, while
another person only has a cellphone number, and another person might have
both.  One person might have three email addresses, while another has none.
A Spanish person will probably have two last names, while an English person
will probably have only one.

One of the reasons that object-oriented programming languages are so popular
is that objects help us to represent and manipulate real world entities with
potentially complex data structures. So far so good.

The problem comes when we need to store these entities. Traditionally, we
have stored our data in columns and rows in a relational database, the
equivalent of using a spreadsheet.  All the flexibility gained
from using objects is lost due to the inflexibility of our
storage medium.

But what if we could store our objects as objects?  Instead of modeling
our application around the limitations of spreadsheets, we can
instead focus on actually *using* the data. The flexibility of
objects is returned to us.

An object is a language-specific, in-memory data structure. To
send it across the network, or store it, we need to be able to represent it
in some standard format.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json:[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)] is
a way of representing objects in human-readable text.  It has become
the _de facto_ standard for exchanging data in the NoSQL world.
When an object has been serialized into JSON it is known as a _JSON document_.

Elasticsearch is a distributed _document_ store. It can
store and retrieve complex data structures -- serialized as JSON documents
-- in _real-time_. In other words, as soon as a document has been stored in
Elasticsearch, it can be retrieved by ID from any node in the cluster.

Of course, we don't only need to store data, we must also
query it, _en masse_ and at speed. While a number of NoSQL solutions
exist which allow us to store objects as documents, they still require
us to think about how we want to query our data, and which fields we
should index in order to make them searchable.

In Elasticsearch, *all data in every field* is *indexed by default*. And, unlike
most other databases, it can *use all those indices in the same
query*, in order to return results at breath taking speed.

In this chapter we will discuss the APIs that we use to create, retrieve,
update and delete documents. For the moment, we don't care about
the data inside our documents or how to query it. All we care about
is how to store our documents safely in Elasticsearch, and how to get
them back again.
