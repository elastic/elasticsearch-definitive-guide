=== Dealing with Conflicts

When updating a document with ((("conflicts", "dealing with")))the `index` API, we read the original document,
make our changes, and then reindex the _whole document_ in one go. The most recent
indexing request wins: whichever document was indexed last is the one stored
in Elasticsearch. If somebody else had changed the document in the meantime,
their changes would be lost.

Many times, this is not a problem.  Perhaps our main data store is a
relational database, and we just copy the data into Elasticsearch to make it
searchable. Perhaps there is little chance of two people changing the same
document at the same time. Or perhaps it doesn't really matter to our business
if we lose changes occasionally.

But sometimes losing a change is _very important_.  Imagine that we're using
Elasticsearch to store the number of widgets that we have in stock in our
online store. Every time that we sell a widget, we decrement the stock count
in Elasticsearch.

One day, management decides to have a sale. Suddenly, we are selling several
widgets every second. Imagine two web processes, running in parallel, both
processing the sale of one widget each, as shown in <<img-data-lww>>.

The change that `web_1` made to the `stock_count` has been lost because
`web_2` is unaware that its copy of the `stock_count` is out-of-date. The
result is that we think we have more widgets than we actually do, and we're
going to disappoint customers by selling them stock that doesn't exist.

The more frequently that changes are made, or the longer the gap between
reading data and updating it, the more likely it is that we will lose changes.

In the database world, two approaches are commonly used to ensure that
changes are not lost when making ((("pessimistic concurrency control")))((("concurrency control")))concurrent updates:

_Pessimistic concurrency control_::

Widely used by relational databases, this approach assumes that conflicting changes are
likely to happen and so blocks access to a resource in order to prevent
conflicts. A typical example is locking a row before reading its data,
ensuring that only the thread that placed the lock is able to make changes to
the data in that row.

_Optimistic concurrency control_::

Used by Elasticsearch, ((("optimistic concurrency control"))) this approach assumes that conflicts are unlikely to happen and
doesn't block operations from being attempted. However, if the underlying data
has been modified between reading and writing, the update will fail. It is
then up to the application to decide how it should resolve the conflict. For
instance, it could reattempt the update, using the fresh data, or it could
report the situation to the user.

=== Optimistic Concurrency Control

Elasticsearch is distributed.  When documents((("concurrency control", "optimistic"))) are created, updated, or deleted,
the new version of the document has to be replicated to other nodes in the
cluster.  Elasticsearch is also asynchronous and  concurrent, meaning that
these replication requests are sent in parallel, and may arrive at their
destination _out of sequence_. Elasticsearch needs a way of ensuring that an older
version of a document never overwrites a newer version.

When we discussed `index`, `get`, and `delete` requests previously, we pointed out
that every document has a `_version` number that is incremented whenever a
document is changed. Elasticsearch uses this `_version` number to ensure that
changes are applied in the correct order. If an older version of a document
arrives after a new version, it can simply be ignored.

We can take advantage of the `_version` number to ensure ((("version number (documents)", "using to avoid conflicts")))that conflicting
changes made by our application do not result in data loss. We do this by
specifying the `version` number of the document that we wish to change.  If that
version is no longer current, our request fails.

Let's create a new blog post:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /website/blog/1/_create
{
  "title": "My first blog entry",
  "text":  "Just trying this out..."
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_Concurrency.json

The response body tells us that this newly created document has `_version`
number `1`.  Now imagine that we want to edit the document: we load its data
into a web form, make our changes, and then save the new version.

First we retrieve the document:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /website/blog/1
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_Concurrency.json


The response body includes the same `_version` number of `1`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "_index" :   "website",
  "_type" :    "blog",
  "_id" :      "1",
  "_version" : 1,
  "found" :    true,
  "_source" :  {
      "title": "My first blog entry",
      "text":  "Just trying this out..."
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

Now, when we try to save our changes by reindexing the document, we specify
the `version` to which our changes should be applied:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /website/blog/1?version=1 <1>
{
  "title": "My first blog entry",
  "text":  "Starting to get the hang of this..."
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_Concurrency.json
<1> We want this update to succeed only if the current `_version` of this
    document in our index is version `1`.

This request succeeds, and the response body tells us that the `_version`
has been incremented to `2`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "_index":   "website",
  "_type":    "blog",
  "_id":      "1",
  "_version": 2
  "created":  false
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_Concurrency.json

However, if we were to rerun the same index request, still specifying
`version=1`, Elasticsearch would respond with a `409 Conflict` HTTP response
code, and a body like the following:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "error": {
      "root_cause": [
         {
            "type": "version_conflict_engine_exception",
            "reason": "[blog][1]: version conflict, current [2], provided [1]",
            "index": "website",
            "shard": "3"
         }
      ],
      "type": "version_conflict_engine_exception",
      "reason": "[blog][1]: version conflict, current [2], provided [1]",
      "index": "website",
      "shard": "3"
   },
   "status": 409
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_Concurrency.json


This tells us that the current `_version` number of the document in
Elasticsearch is `2`, but that we specified that we were updating version `1`.

What we do now depends on our application requirements.  We could tell the
user that somebody else has already made changes to the document, and to review the changes before trying to save them again.
Alternatively, as in the case of the widget `stock_count` previously, we could
retrieve the latest document and try to reapply the change.

All APIs that update or delete a document accept a `version` parameter, which
allows you to apply optimistic concurrency control to just the parts of your
code where it makes sense.

==== Using Versions from an External System

A common setup is to use some other database as the primary data store and
Elasticsearch to make the data searchable,((("version number (documents)", "using an external version number")))((("external version numbers"))) which means that all changes to the
primary database need to be copied across to Elasticsearch as they happen.  If
multiple processes are responsible for this data synchronization, you may
run into concurrency problems similar to those described previously.

If your main database already has version numbers--or a value such as
`timestamp` that can be used as a version number--then  you can reuse these
same version numbers in Elasticsearch by adding `version_type=external` to the
query string.((("query strings", "version_type=external"))) Version numbers must be integers greater than zero and less than
about `9.2e+18`--a positive `long` value in Java.

The way external version numbers are handled is a bit different from the
internal version numbers  we discussed previously.  Instead of checking that the
current `_version` is _the same_ as the one specified in the request,
Elasticsearch checks that the current `_version` is _less than_ the specified
version. If the request succeeds, the external version number is stored as the
document's new `_version`.

External version numbers can be specified not only on
index and delete requests, but also when _creating_ new documents.

For instance, to create a new blog post with an external version number
of `5`, we can do the following:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /website/blog/2?version=5&version_type=external
{
  "title": "My first external blog entry",
  "text":  "Starting to get the hang of this..."
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_External_versions.json

In the response, we can see that the current `_version` number is `5`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "_index":   "website",
  "_type":    "blog",
  "_id":      "2",
  "_version": 5,
  "created":  true
}
--------------------------------------------------

Now we update this document, specifying a new `version` number of `10`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /website/blog/2?version=10&version_type=external
{
  "title": "My first external blog entry",
  "text":  "This is a piece of cake..."
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 030_Data/40_External_versions.json

The request succeeds and sets the current `_version` to `10`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "_index":   "website",
  "_type":    "blog",
  "_id":      "2",
  "_version": 10,
  "created":  false
}
--------------------------------------------------

If you were to rerun this request, it would fail with the same conflict error
we saw before, because the specified external version number is not higher
than the current version in Elasticsearch.
