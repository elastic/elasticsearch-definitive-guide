== Analysis – preparing data for searching

Textual data comes in many different forms: prose, computer code, different 
languages, URLs, emails, file paths, postcodes etc. elasticsearch makes sense 
of these different formats by analysing textual data into terms. This chapter 
explains the analysis process and how to customize to suit the data and
seach requirements.
